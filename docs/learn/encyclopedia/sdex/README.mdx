The Stellar network lets users trade in a free market using [priced orders](../../fundamentals/transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#manage-sell-offer), [path payments](../transactions-specialized/path-payments.mdx), and [automated market makers](./liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools.mdx#liquidity-pools-amm). These features leverage both the SDEX orderbooks from Protocol 1 and liquidity pools from Protocol 18. To learn about how the native exchanges work together to enable seamless cross-asset transactions, see our [Path Payments Encyclopedia Entry](../transactions-specialized/path-payments.mdx).
