# Ledger Entries

Data is stored on the ledger as ledger entries, akin to key-value stores. Each key is a `LedgerKey` entry defined in [protocol XDR](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/v23.0/Stellar-ledger-entries.x#L588), with values as `LedgerEntry` instances. Keys define which object we reference, while entries contain the data stored at that key in [protocol XDR](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/v23.0/Stellar-ledger-entries.x#L548).

Because `LedgerEntries` are a full record of ledger data, they include the identifying key. These fungible key identifiers and fields lower excess variables, using the same subset of XDR structure. There are 10 different forms a ledger key can take:

### Account

The `AccountEntry` holistically defines a Stellar account, including its balance, sequence number, thresholds, signers, and flags. See [Accounts](../accounts.mdx) section.

- **Key:** Identified by `AccountID`
- **Entry:** Full account record including balance, sequence number, thresholds, flags, home domain, and list of signers. Tracks [subentries](../accounts.mdx#subentries) that drive the minimum balance requirement.

### Trustline

The `TrustLineEntry` defines a balance line to a non-native asset issued on the network. Created and updated via [`changeTrustOp`](../../transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#change-trust).

- **Key:** `(AccountID, asset)`
- **Entry:** Trustline state for a non-native asset. Stores the asset balance, limit, authorization flags, and trading liability counters.

### Offer

The `OfferEntry` represents an offer made on the SDEX order book. See [Liquidity on Stellar](../../liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools.mdx#orderbook) DEX section.

- **Key:** `(sellerID, offerID)`
- **Entry:** A single offer on the DEX. Contains the selling and buying assets, amount, price, and [passive](../../liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools.mdx#passive-offer) flags.

### Account Data

A `DataEntry` stores key-value data entries attached to an account. Used through the [`manageDataOp`](../../transactions/list-of-operations.mdx#manage-data).

- **Key:** `(accountID, dataName)`
- **Entry:** Arbitrary key-value pair (`DataValue`) attached to an account.

### Claimable Balance

The `ClaimableBalanceEntry` tracks a balance that may or may not actively be claimable. See [Claimable Balances](../../../../build/guides/transactions/claimable-balances.mdx) guide.

- **Key:** `balanceID`
- **Entry:** Tracks the asset, amount, claimants, [predicates](../../../../build/guides/transactions/claimable-balances.mdx#other-parameters), and optional flags.

### Liquidity Pool

The `LiquidityPoolEntry` defines the configuration of a constant-product liquidity pool between two assets. See [Liquidity on Stellar](../../liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools.mdx#liquidity-pools) section.

- **Key:** `liquidityPoolID`
- **Entry:** Holds pool parameters (two assets, fee rate), reserves, total pool shares, and a pool's trustline count (to prevent entry scanning).

### Contract Data

`ContractDataEntry` stores a piece of data under a contract-defined key. See [Persisting Contract Data](../../contract-development/storage/persisting-data.mdx#ledger-entries) section.

- **Key:** `(contract, key, durability)`
- **Entry:** Stores the `SCVal` value associated with that key under the contract. Used for Soroban data storage alongside keys.

### Contract Code

The `ContractCodeEntry` contains the Wasm bytecode of a Soroban contract. See [Smart Contracts Overview](../../../../build/smart-contracts/overview.mdx) page.

- **Key:** `hash` of the Wasm module.
- **Entry:** Contains the Wasm bytecode and associated cost inputs to deploy or invoke contracts. [Fee metadata](../../fees-resource-limits-metering.mdx#resource-fee) takes into account component factors like number of instructions, functions, and variables.

### Config Setting

The `ConfigSettingEntry` holds governed network configuration values for over a dozen rules. See [Soroban Settings](../../../../validators/admin-guide/soroban-settings.mdx) section.

- **Key:** `configSettingID` (index of setting [in list](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/blob/4b7a2ef7931ab2ca2499be68d849f38190b443ca/Stellar-contract-config-setting.x#L319-L338))
- **Entry:** Active value of a network-level parameter (e.g., protocol limits, compute fees, state archival). The whole validator quorum set has to agree on these values.

### TTL

The `TTLEntry` defines the time-to-live of an associated contract data or code entry.

- **Key:** `keyHash` (hash of associated LedgerKey).
- **Entry:** Defines the expiration ledger sequence (`liveUntilLedgerSeq`) for temporary objects such as contract data or code.

## Working with ledger entries

Most products only need to reason about a subset of ledger entriesâ€”for example, accounts, trustlines, and liquidity pools cover the majority of asset and trading use cases. Once you understand how to build and parse a few representative keys and entries, you can extrapolate the same patterns to the remaining entry types.

Ledger entries are always mutated through transactions: operations either create, update, or delete these records as part of applying a transaction set. Use [`getLedgerEntries`](../../../../data/apis/rpc/api-reference/methods/getLedgerEntries.mdx) when you need to fetch the raw on-ledger representation for debugging or cross-checking derived data.
