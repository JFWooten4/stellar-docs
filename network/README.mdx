The network architechture of Stellar is amazing. Go ahead, check it out!

## Horizon

Horizon is an API for interacting with the Stellar network.

This API serves the bridge between apps and Stellar Core. Projects like wallets,
decentralized exchanges, and asset issuers use Horizon to submit transactions,
query an account balance, or stream events like transactions to an account.

Hubble is your go-to source for viewing, analyzing, and understanding historic
data from the Stellar network.

## Soroban RPC

If you are writing or interacting with smart contracts, you'll need to use RPC.
This is the best platform to see current state of the Stellar network.

## Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is a set of tools and APIs that enable developers and
businesses to build their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network.
It provides a standardized interface, including the implementation of several
Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), to make it easy for businesses to integrate
with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.
