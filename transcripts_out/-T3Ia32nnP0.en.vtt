Hello and welcome everyone to this week's Stella developer meeting. With me

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.830 align:start position:0%
week's Stella developer meeting. With me today I have two guests that have been

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.709 align:start position:0%
today I have two guests that have been around here before from Open Seelin.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.230 align:start position:0%
around here before from Open Seelin. And what we're going to do today is

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.230 align:start position:0%
And what we're going to do today is we're going to take a look at what has

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a look at what has been added to the Open Seelin tool chain

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.070 align:start position:0%
been added to the Open Seelin tool chain and and the libraries that are

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.550 align:start position:0%
and and the libraries that are supporting Stellar for the last

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.550 align:start position:0%
supporting Stellar for the last quarter. So I'm super excited. I know

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.630 align:start position:0%
quarter. So I'm super excited. I know we're going to start we're going to talk

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.230 align:start position:0%
we're going to start we're going to talk about smart contracts. We're going to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.430 align:start position:0%
about smart contracts. We're going to talk about RWAS. We're going to talk

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.310 align:start position:0%
talk about RWAS. We're going to talk about WAS. So, so yeah, please

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.069 align:start position:0%
about WAS. So, so yeah, please introduce yourself and let's get

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and let's get started.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Hello everyone. It's really a pleasure to be to participate again

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be to participate again at the stellar developer meeting. my

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.229 align:start position:0%
at the stellar developer meeting. my name is Buan. I'm open source developer

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.069 align:start position:0%
name is Buan. I'm open source developer at at open zeppelin. , and I'm

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.390 align:start position:0%
at at open zeppelin. , and I'm building the stellar contracts library.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.429 align:start position:0%
building the stellar contracts library. &gt;&gt; Hi everyone, it's Ugun here. ,

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone, it's Ugun here. , pleasure to be here. Good to be here.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.550 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here. Good to be here. And I am also an open source developer

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
And I am also an open source developer at Open Zeppelin. We are a team with

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
at Open Zeppelin. We are a team with Voyan trying to bring trying to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.710 align:start position:0%
Voyan trying to bring trying to improve the smart contract ecosystem for

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
improve the smart contract ecosystem for Stellar Sorovan.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.910 align:start position:0%
Stellar Sorovan. &gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. So we've done quite a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.950 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you. So we've done quite a few hackathons this year and it's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
few hackathons this year and it's really great to see that some of the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.710 align:start position:0%
really great to see that some of the developers they're starting to use open

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.990 align:start position:0%
developers they're starting to use open sin software and the the libraries

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.149 align:start position:0%
sin software and the the libraries and the tooling. and I think what

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.749 align:start position:0%
and the tooling. and I think what what you're going to show today is going

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
what you're going to show today is going to be really interesting for a lot of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.670 align:start position:0%
to be really interesting for a lot of developers. So if you have a

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.630 align:start position:0%
developers. So if you have a presentation you can share.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.030 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. I I will start. ,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.476 align:start position:0%
let me show my screen.

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:12.630 align:start position:0%
[clears throat]

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
Yeah, there it is. Sorry. Sorry about that. , yeah. So

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.091 align:start position:0%
that. , yeah. So I'm going to present to you today the

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
I'm going to present to you today the [clears throat]

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.309 align:start position:0%
[clears throat] smart account framework that we

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.750 align:start position:0%
smart account framework that we created with released with the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.949 align:start position:0%
created with released with the latest u latest release of of our

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.470 align:start position:0%
latest u latest release of of our library.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.509 align:start position:0%
library. just to to mention that yeah

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.229 align:start position:0%
just to to mention that yeah already a month ago when with some of

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.470 align:start position:0%
already a month ago when with some of you we met at at Meridian in in

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.110 align:start position:0%
you we met at at Meridian in in Rio. how excited I I was and I I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.430 align:start position:0%
Rio. how excited I I was and I I guess it was the case for everyone to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.309 align:start position:0%
guess it was the case for everyone to use pass keys to have all this

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
use pass keys to have all this like wallet experience abstracted into

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
like wallet experience abstracted into into into smart account. So our

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
into into smart account. So our ambition is to make this the new normal

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.869 align:start position:0%
ambition is to make this the new normal for stellar. So yeah we are building

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.350 align:start position:0%
for stellar. So yeah we are building this framework u with with that in

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.190 align:start position:0%
this framework u with with that in mind. So without further ado yeah

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.589 align:start position:0%
mind. So without further ado yeah let's dive in. first

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start position:0%
let's dive in. first a point about naming and why we chose

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
a point about naming and why we chose smart account and not smart wallet.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.589 align:start position:0%
smart account and not smart wallet. first [clears throat] the storebone

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.509 align:start position:0%
first [clears throat] the storebone SDK defines custom account and custom

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.789 align:start position:0%
SDK defines custom account and custom account interface and our design builds

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.589 align:start position:0%
account interface and our design builds on top of it. So that's why we we

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.789 align:start position:0%
on top of it. So that's why we we decided to to choose smart account as

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.830 align:start position:0%
decided to to choose smart account as a as a naming and yeah smart account

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.670 align:start position:0%
a as a naming and yeah smart account must implement this interface.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.710 align:start position:0%
must implement this interface. then why smart accounts are

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
then why smart accounts are necessary? let's just explore a very

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.390 align:start position:0%
necessary? let's just explore a very simple scenario.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
simple scenario.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.590 align:start position:0%
where a smart account that holds some funible tokens

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.469 align:start position:0%
some funible tokens and the owner of the contract wants

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
and the owner of the contract wants to transfer some amount and that's why

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.990 align:start position:0%
to transfer some amount and that's why they need to call a function on the USDC

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.550 align:start position:0%
they need to call a function on the USDC contract. In this case,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.270 align:start position:0%
contract. In this case, they will make use of a cryptographic

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.110 align:start position:0%
they will make use of a cryptographic key that is registered at this smart

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.230 align:start position:0%
key that is registered at this smart account to authorize the the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
account to authorize the the operation.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
operation. And by looking from this perspective, we

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.629 align:start position:0%
And by looking from this perspective, we the perspective of account abraction,

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.310 align:start position:0%
the perspective of account abraction, we we are establishing a boundary

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.670 align:start position:0%
we we are establishing a boundary between the account that holds the sets

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.870 align:start position:0%
between the account that holds the sets and the keys that that control them.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.270 align:start position:0%
and the keys that that control them. now let's try to define what a smart

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.629 align:start position:0%
now let's try to define what a smart account is. So let's this is a smart

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.629 align:start position:0%
account is. So let's this is a smart contract first and foremost that

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
contract first and foremost that composes authorization intents that are

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
composes authorization intents that are coming from multiple sources and this

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
coming from multiple sources and this high level definition will guide us

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.909 align:start position:0%
high level definition will guide us through the the the all the com the all

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.029 align:start position:0%
through the the the all the com the all the components of our framework.

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
the components of our framework. with this in mind, let's first see

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.070 align:start position:0%
with this in mind, let's first see what are what the authorization sources

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.909 align:start position:0%
what are what the authorization sources could be. as in the previous example,

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.670 align:start position:0%
could be. as in the previous example, an authorization source could be a

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.790 align:start position:0%
an authorization source could be a cryptographic key or there could be

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.909 align:start position:0%
cryptographic key or there could be multiple cryptographic keys for the

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.749 align:start position:0%
multiple cryptographic keys for the same smart account or it could be a G

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.510 align:start position:0%
same smart account or it could be a G account that authorizes on behalf of

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.189 align:start position:0%
account that authorizes on behalf of of the smart account or it could be any

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
of the smart account or it could be any combination of of these cryptographic

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.350 align:start position:0%
combination of of these cryptographic keys, G accounts or other smart accounts

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
keys, G accounts or other smart accounts and smart contracts.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.550 align:start position:0%
and smart contracts. the next part of the definition

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.350 align:start position:0%
the next part of the definition talked about authorization intents.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.909 align:start position:0%
talked about authorization intents. what are and yeah we will see what are

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.590 align:start position:0%
what are and yeah we will see what are the core elements of of the

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
the core elements of of the authorization intent.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.909 align:start position:0%
authorization intent. we can examine this by answering

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
we can examine this by answering these three questions. We can define who

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.390 align:start position:0%
these three questions. We can define who is allowed to act what are they

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.350 align:start position:0%
is allowed to act what are they allowed to do and how those permissions

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.469 align:start position:0%
allowed to do and how those permissions are enforced.

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.029 align:start position:0%
are enforced. who is allowed to act? This might be

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
who is allowed to act? This might be already clear. those could be some

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.350 align:start position:0%
already clear. those could be some keys from different cryptographic

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
keys from different cryptographic curves also G accounts C accounts.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.749 align:start position:0%
curves also G accounts C accounts. what are they allowed to do? Well,

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
what are they allowed to do? Well, here this can be literally any kind of

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.629 align:start position:0%
here this can be literally any kind of action either a specific function on

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
action either a specific function on a specific contract or just transfer

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.350 align:start position:0%
a specific contract or just transfer the transfer function on any SCP 41

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.710 align:start position:0%
the transfer function on any SCP 41 compatible contract deploy deployments

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
compatible contract deploy deployments as well. So yeah, any kind of action

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
as well. So yeah, any kind of action how is this enforced also many

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.749 align:start position:0%
how is this enforced also many different combinations are possible. It

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:29.110 align:start position:0%
different combinations are possible. It could be key one and key2. Key1 or key2

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.909 align:start position:0%
could be key one and key2. Key1 or key2 key1 and some other conditions that are

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.870 align:start position:0%
key1 and some other conditions that are not derived from the from a

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
not derived from the from a cryptographic scheme

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.550 align:start position:0%
cryptographic scheme and to give names to those groups. Who

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
and to give names to those groups. Who is for signers? What is the scope and

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.029 align:start position:0%
is for signers? What is the scope and how how is for the policies?

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.550 align:start position:0%
how how is for the policies? how do we compose those elements?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.469 align:start position:0%
how do we compose those elements? So we have signers scope and policies

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.909 align:start position:0%
So we have signers scope and policies and we embed them in the entity called

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
and we embed them in the entity called context rule. here you see that

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.189 align:start position:0%
context rule. here you see that besides the signer scope and the

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
besides the signer scope and the policies we also have the the notion of

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
policies we also have the the notion of validity.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.270 align:start position:0%
validity. context rules function like

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
context rules function like routing table for authorizations for

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0%
routing table for authorizations for every context. they they specify the

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.230 align:start position:0%
every context. they they specify the scope and the conditions that must be

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.029 align:start position:0%
scope and the conditions that must be met before the authorization is

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:28.869 align:start position:0%
met before the authorization is granted and yeah we'll see how this

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:33.509 align:start position:0%
granted and yeah we'll see how this this goes very shortly. So a a smart

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:37.029 align:start position:0%
this goes very shortly. So a a smart account is stores a set of those context

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.589 align:start position:0%
account is stores a set of those context rules and up to 15 rules per we can

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
rules and up to 15 rules per we can have up to 15 rules per smart account.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.110 align:start position:0%
have up to 15 rules per smart account. We added this limit to ensure there a

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.430 align:start position:0%
We added this limit to ensure there a reasonable resource consump consumption

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.829 align:start position:0%
reasonable resource consump consumption and to encourage proactive management.

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
and to encourage proactive management. For example, to encourage you to remove

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.509 align:start position:0%
For example, to encourage you to remove the expired or unused rules.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.790 align:start position:0%
the expired or unused rules. And coming back to this authorization

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.190 align:start position:0%
And coming back to this authorization mechanism or algorithm, actually it's

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.509 align:start position:0%
mechanism or algorithm, actually it's pretty simple.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
pretty simple. when the authorization from a smart

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
when the authorization from a smart account is required first we we

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.470 align:start position:0%
account is required first we we gather and order all non-expired rules

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.710 align:start position:0%
gather and order all non-expired rules and then we evaluate them starting from

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
and then we evaluate them starting from the last addit last last addit one

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
the last addit last last addit one now let's zoom into signers

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
now let's zoom into signers we have two types of signers

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
we have two types of signers delegated and external

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
delegated and external a delegated signer can be any sorbon

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.990 align:start position:0%
a delegated signer can be any sorbon address, G account or C account. And

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
address, G account or C account. And on the right we group all

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
on the right we group all cryptographic types of schemes or

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.150 align:start position:0%
cryptographic types of schemes or keys in in the external variant. And

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.230 align:start position:0%
keys in in the external variant. And we'll see just in a second why we

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.110 align:start position:0%
we'll see just in a second why we call it external.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.910 align:start position:0%
call it external. But first how the delegated signer

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.710 align:start position:0%
But first how the delegated signer grants an authorization. Codewise

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.070 align:start position:0%
grants an authorization. Codewise it's very simple. we use the built-in

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
it's very simple. we use the built-in require out for arcs function and

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
require out for arcs function and however there is a catch I of how

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
however there is a catch I of how we are actually constructing this

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.949 align:start position:0%
we are actually constructing this this transaction

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
this transaction I won't go

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.230 align:start position:0%
I won't go I won't dive into this sketch I

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
I won't dive into this sketch I it's like you can find more

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
it's like you can find more information about it in the

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
information about it in the documentation and there are some code

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.069 align:start position:0%
documentation and there are some code snippets explaining how to to get

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
snippets explaining how to to get over it. just mentioning it and

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
over it. just mentioning it and that the cap 71 that hopefully gets

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.230 align:start position:0%
that the cap 71 that hopefully gets included in some of the future

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.389 align:start position:0%
included in some of the future protocol updates will resolve these

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
protocol updates will resolve these issues. So yeah very soon I hope

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
issues. So yeah very soon I hope it will be a u no issue.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.230 align:start position:0%
it will be a u no issue. the second signer type is the

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.870 align:start position:0%
the second signer type is the external one for authorizations coming

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.949 align:start position:0%
external one for authorizations coming from cryptographic keys.

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:08.870 align:start position:0%
from cryptographic keys. But before we look into into that,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
But before we look into into that, I'm here providing a list of the curves

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.310 align:start position:0%
I'm here providing a list of the curves on stellar

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
on stellar there the already available ones

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
there the already available ones that are supported and BN 256 that might

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.870 align:start position:0%
that are supported and BN 256 that might get added with protocol 25.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.069 align:start position:0%
get added with protocol 25. and yeah, I I guess there there

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:30.949 align:start position:0%
and yeah, I I guess there there could be many more in the future. and

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:33.829 align:start position:0%
could be many more in the future. and you remember the structure of of the

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
you remember the structure of of the external serer

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.069 align:start position:0%
external serer like to go back it's a tle of address

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:43.509 align:start position:0%
like to go back it's a tle of address and by and byes

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
and by and byes we could have defined its structure like

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
we could have defined its structure like this by enumerating all available curves

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
this by enumerating all available curves and the [snorts] bytes that should be

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.190 align:start position:0%
and the [snorts] bytes that should be interpreted according to the to the

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.190 align:start position:0%
interpreted according to the to the curve type. But you you would agree that

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.870 align:start position:0%
curve type. But you you would agree that this approach is not very scalable

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.509 align:start position:0%
this approach is not very scalable because on every new curve that is added

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:05.910 align:start position:0%
because on every new curve that is added you have to upgrade your account if

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
you have to upgrade your account if it supports it and this is not practical

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.269 align:start position:0%
it supports it and this is not practical at all. another drawback of embedding

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.269 align:start position:0%
at all. another drawback of embedding signature verification into the smart

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:18.389 align:start position:0%
signature verification into the smart account is that it binary size will grow

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
account is that it binary size will grow and the code complexity will increase as

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.829 align:start position:0%
and the code complexity will increase as well. For example, the ED the classical

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
well. For example, the ED the classical ED 25

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
ED 25 119 like it's just one liner but pass

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
119 like it's just one liner but pass key verification for example is pretty

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
key verification for example is pretty much is more evolved and requires more

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.910 align:start position:0%
much is more evolved and requires more like more code simply

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.069 align:start position:0%
like more code simply this pushed us to adopt a way more

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
this pushed us to adopt a way more flexible and scalable approach that is

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
flexible and scalable approach that is outsourcing and externalizing all type

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.990 align:start position:0%
outsourcing and externalizing all type of signature verifications.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.069 align:start position:0%
of signature verifications. So we have a verifier contract

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:56.629 align:start position:0%
So we have a verifier contract that stands for this address and the

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.870 align:start position:0%
that stands for this address and the public key that is the the bytes.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
public key that is the the bytes. this verifier contract is a special

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
this verifier contract is a special one. It is deployed only once per curve

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:11.430 align:start position:0%
one. It is deployed only once per curve type or scheme and should be immutable.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
type or scheme and should be immutable. it's it shouldn't keep any state and

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.670 align:start position:0%
it's it shouldn't keep any state and in such way a single verifier contract

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.470 align:start position:0%
in such way a single verifier contract can validate signature signatures for

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
can validate signature signatures for any any number of keys.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.150 align:start position:0%
any any number of keys. and yeah this was made possible

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
and yeah this was made possible thanks to protocol 23 and that

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.550 align:start position:0%
thanks to protocol 23 and that made the the cross contract calls

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.829 align:start position:0%
made the the cross contract calls really cheap.

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
really cheap. Now let's look into policies.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.509 align:start position:0%
Now let's look into policies. So we have here

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:45.269 align:start position:0%
So we have here

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.949 align:start position:0%
one context rule with the scope, the signers and the policies. Let's say we

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:54.150 align:start position:0%
signers and the policies. Let's say we have three signers, two cryptographic

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
have three signers, two cryptographic keys and one G account. And actually the

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
keys and one G account. And actually the policies

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.069 align:start position:0%
policies they they modify they customize the

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.470 align:start position:0%
they they modify they customize the how signers behave. Here in this case

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.750 align:start position:0%
how signers behave. Here in this case we require any two of those three

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.829 align:start position:0%
we require any two of those three signers to sign to sign so that the

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
signers to sign to sign so that the authorization

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
authorization passes it's the policies also can modify

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.629 align:start position:0%
passes it's the policies also can modify some other aspects of of the flow

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
some other aspects of of the flow here. In this case, we want those

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.629 align:start position:0%
here. In this case, we want those rule to be enforced only for once per

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:33.030 align:start position:0%
rule to be enforced only for once per month.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.069 align:start position:0%
month. so that like you can for example pay for

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:38.949 align:start position:0%
so that like you can for example pay for a subscription.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:42.949 align:start position:0%
a subscription. So policies are external contracts as

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
So policies are external contracts as like verifiers.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
like verifiers. the verifiers are external. So

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:50.230 align:start position:0%
the verifiers are external. So policies are also external contracts.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.110 align:start position:0%
policies are also external contracts. Policies can be stateful or stateless

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
Policies can be stateful or stateless meaning they can map some state

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
meaning they can map some state for a specific account and context

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.030 align:start position:0%
for a specific account and context rule. They can be shared across many

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.550 align:start position:0%
rule. They can be shared across many different accounts or can be tied

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.389 align:start position:0%
different accounts or can be tied just for a specific smart account.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:15.269 align:start position:0%
just for a specific smart account. And the other aspect is that they have a

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:19.269 align:start position:0%
And the other aspect is that they have a four stage life cycle.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:24.310 align:start position:0%
four stage life cycle. which is visible from the interface that

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.910 align:start position:0%
which is visible from the interface that those policies must adhere to.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
those policies must adhere to. Now if we look into this spending

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.230 align:start position:0%
Now if we look into this spending limit policy, it is let's say it's a

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.870 align:start position:0%
limit policy, it is let's say it's a stateful policy and it is shared across

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
stateful policy and it is shared across multiple smart accounts. When this

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
multiple smart accounts. When this policy is added to a context rule, the

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
policy is added to a context rule, the install hook is called and this in its

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.310 align:start position:0%
install hook is called and this in its the storage for the calling account and

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.910 align:start position:0%
the storage for the calling account and sets the amount and the time period. For

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.749 align:start position:0%
sets the amount and the time period. For example, here we'll have 100 USDC and

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:59.829 align:start position:0%
example, here we'll have 100 USDC and one month. This is the in in it

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:05.430 align:start position:0%
one month. This is the in in it params that are pass can enforce

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.269 align:start position:0%
params that are pass can enforce is just a read function that is

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:11.189 align:start position:0%
is just a read function that is invoked every time the evaluation

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:13.749 align:start position:0%
invoked every time the evaluation loop runs.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
loop runs. Enforce on the other hand it requires

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
Enforce on the other hand it requires authorization from the already

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.790 align:start position:0%
authorization from the already installed smart account and modifies can

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.509 align:start position:0%
installed smart account and modifies can modify the storage and can emit

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.269 align:start position:0%
modify the storage and can emit events.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
events. Uninstall is called when the is removed.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.230 align:start position:0%
Uninstall is called when the is removed. So we are cleaning up the policy

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.749 align:start position:0%
So we are cleaning up the policy storage. So install and uninstall are

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:37.350 align:start position:0%
storage. So install and uninstall are used only once can enforce on every

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.470 align:start position:0%
used only once can enforce on every evaluation loop and enforce when

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
evaluation loop and enforce when context rule is matched.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.389 align:start position:0%
context rule is matched. So these are the main elements of smart

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.310 align:start position:0%
So these are the main elements of smart account and yeah to sum it up we we

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.590 align:start position:0%
account and yeah to sum it up we we have we can have up to 15 context rules

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.069 align:start position:0%
have we can have up to 15 context rules per smart account and each context

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:00.870 align:start position:0%
per smart account and each context through contains signers and policies.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.669 align:start position:0%
through contains signers and policies. So let's see some use cases.

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:10.390 align:start position:0%
So let's see some use cases. yeah the most like trivial one

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.630 align:start position:0%
yeah the most like trivial one is the multisix threshold bas

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.669 align:start position:0%
is the multisix threshold bas based or like the weighted

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:22.789 align:start position:0%
based or like the weighted multics. We can have with this u

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.029 align:start position:0%
multics. We can have with this u setup we can have time limited app

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
setup we can have time limited app sessions. For example you install

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.310 align:start position:0%
sessions. For example you install context rule that is specific for a

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.029 align:start position:0%
context rule that is specific for a specific app and it's valid just for one

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:34.710 align:start position:0%
specific app and it's valid just for one day.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.029 align:start position:0%
day. so you don't so you can interact with

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.430 align:start position:0%
so you don't so you can interact with this app without needing to approve any

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.950 align:start position:0%
this app without needing to approve any any further transactions. you can add

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.630 align:start position:0%
any further transactions. you can add for example the keys for AI agent or bot

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.669 align:start position:0%
for example the keys for AI agent or bot to as a context rule and allow it to

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
to as a context rule and allow it to spend some like limited amount of

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.070 align:start position:0%
spend some like limited amount of your assets so it can trade for example

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.070 align:start position:0%
your assets so it can trade for example and you don't risk to get wrecked or

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.710 align:start position:0%
and you don't risk to get wrecked or you can subscribe for some

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
you can subscribe for some services. So yeah let and here let's see

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.029 align:start position:0%
services. So yeah let and here let's see how the subscription the flow the user

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
how the subscription the flow the user flow for a subscription will happen. So

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.950 align:start position:0%
flow for a subscription will happen. So I have a smart account and I have the

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.909 align:start position:0%
I have a smart account and I have the sudo sudo rule like the the super admin

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:24.789 align:start position:0%
sudo sudo rule like the the super admin rule that is has a single signer

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:27.909 align:start position:0%
rule that is has a single signer my pass key and there are no policies

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:33.750 align:start position:0%
my pass key and there are no policies and it's valid forever.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.870 align:start position:0%
and it's valid forever. Then I I'm going to u some DAP and I

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.390 align:start position:0%
Then I I'm going to u some DAP and I want to subscribe to a service. The

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
want to subscribe to a service. The DAP prompts me to install a context rule

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
DAP prompts me to install a context rule that contains the scope of it is the

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
that contains the scope of it is the USD contract because I'm going to pay in

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.830 align:start position:0%
USD contract because I'm going to pay in USDC.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.669 align:start position:0%
USDC. The signer is the D pub key. and the

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:01.029 align:start position:0%
The signer is the D pub key. and the policy is some spending limit polic

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
policy is some spending limit polic policy that limits the the spending for

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.630 align:start position:0%
policy that limits the the spending for up to 20 20 bucks per month and I'm

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
up to 20 20 bucks per month and I'm subscribing for one year. So this is the

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.029 align:start position:0%
subscribing for one year. So this is the single transaction I have to do u in

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:19.029 align:start position:0%
single transaction I have to do u in order to subscribe for this service.

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:21.990 align:start position:0%
order to subscribe for this service. And from this moment on the DAP

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.310 align:start position:0%
And from this moment on the DAP developer for example they can use

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.630 align:start position:0%
developer for example they can use the open zeppelin monitors to subscribe

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.789 align:start position:0%
the open zeppelin monitors to subscribe to the install event on this policy

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
to the install event on this policy and when this gets triggered they

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:36.549 align:start position:0%
and when this gets triggered they will with a relayer they with the

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
will with a relayer they with the opposite layer they will charge the user

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.990 align:start position:0%
opposite layer they will charge the user smart accounts every every month

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.789 align:start position:0%
smart accounts every every month 20 bucks.

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:51.190 align:start position:0%
20 bucks. So the key takeaways this this

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.190 align:start position:0%
So the key takeaways this this framework is

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.230 align:start position:0%
framework is context centric framework. I will

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
context centric framework. I will compare it as the I'm comparing it very

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
compare it as the I'm comparing it very often with the web to login experience.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
often with the web to login experience. For example, when you are logging it

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
For example, when you are logging it with your Google account or your

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.390 align:start position:0%
with your Google account or your GitHub account like you authorize the

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.029 align:start position:0%
GitHub account like you authorize the third party with some specific

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.789 align:start position:0%
third party with some specific permissions. We grant some scope

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:22.150 align:start position:0%
permissions. We grant some scope permission. you don't grant the whole

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.590 align:start position:0%
permission. you don't grant the whole access to your data but just to very

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.549 align:start position:0%
access to your data but just to very like scoped permissions. So we are

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
like scoped permissions. So we are composing authorization intents

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:36.870 align:start position:0%
composing authorization intents through those context rules that contain

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.549 align:start position:0%
through those context rules that contain signers and policies.

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.390 align:start position:0%
signers and policies. Another very important aspect is that

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.710 align:start position:0%
Another very important aspect is that signature verification is not hardcoded

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.990 align:start position:0%
signature verification is not hardcoded into the smart account. So it is this is

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
into the smart account. So it is this is very flexible and very scalable and

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
very flexible and very scalable and yeah like this framework enables

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
yeah like this framework enables programmable authorization in in that

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.430 align:start position:0%
programmable authorization in in that manner.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.149 align:start position:0%
manner. So yeah if you want to play with it

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:10.710 align:start position:0%
So yeah if you want to play with it I'm inviting you to go to our repo and

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.270 align:start position:0%
I'm inviting you to go to our repo and to check our docs.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.549 align:start position:0%
to check our docs. and yeah I'm pausing it here for

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:22.549 align:start position:0%
and yeah I'm pausing it here for questions if there are any.

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.950 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any. Great. It it was really interesting.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.750 align:start position:0%
Great. It it was really interesting. we have seen a lot of interest in in

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.310 align:start position:0%
we have seen a lot of interest in in using pass keys and I think I think

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.149 align:start position:0%
using pass keys and I think I think there's so many ways to do like there's

00:21:36.159 --> 00:21:38.390 align:start position:0%
there's so many ways to do like there's so many capabilities in Sora for

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.270 align:start position:0%
so many capabilities in Sora for authorization but it's also complicated.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.190 align:start position:0%
authorization but it's also complicated. It's not it's not straightforward

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
It's not it's not straightforward forward and easy. I think the the wealth

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.750 align:start position:0%
forward and easy. I think the the wealth of opportunities to create custom

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.590 align:start position:0%
of opportunities to create custom policies and authorize your users in

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.190 align:start position:0%
policies and authorize your users in different ways. I think it it it's

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
different ways. I think it it it's great, but it's also a little bit

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.270 align:start position:0%
great, but it's also a little bit complicated. So, the framework you

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.430 align:start position:0%
complicated. So, the framework you present here makes that a lot easier. I

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.390 align:start position:0%
present here makes that a lot easier. I think this will be be a great great way

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.710 align:start position:0%
think this will be be a great great way to to add a flexible authorization to

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.270 align:start position:0%
to to add a flexible authorization to to your DAP. So very interesting to see.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.909 align:start position:0%
to your DAP. So very interesting to see. I think I'll I'll drop the link to the

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:19.029 align:start position:0%
I think I'll I'll drop the link to the to the repo or to the documentation. But

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:21.190 align:start position:0%
to the repo or to the documentation. But if anyone has any questions, I think

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.950 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions, I think yeah, Elliots has a question here.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
yeah, Elliots has a question here. &gt;&gt; yeah, did you say that Ozair can be used

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yeah, did you say that Ozair can be used to index track additions removal or

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
to index track additions removal or Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean you

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean you there are some events that you can

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.669 align:start position:0%
there are some events that you can subscribe on

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:41.990 align:start position:0%
subscribe on subscribe for those events on the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.710 align:start position:0%
subscribe for those events on the policies or on the on the your smart

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.669 align:start position:0%
policies or on the on the your smart account and yeah do do yeah

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
account and yeah do do yeah trigger some actions according according

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
trigger some actions according according to whatever you want to do.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
to whatever you want to do. , one naming concern, smart account

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.149 align:start position:0%
, one naming concern, smart account will likely overlap with stellar

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:06.310 align:start position:0%
will likely overlap with stellar accounts and could confuse the idea that

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.630 align:start position:0%
accounts and could confuse the idea that this is a contract.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start position:0%
this is a contract. &gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:13.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yeah. ,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.190 align:start position:0%
Yeah. , yeah. I I presented why we ch why we

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.590 align:start position:0%
yeah. I I presented why we ch why we went with smart account. , yeah.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
went with smart account. , yeah. mentioned that that this is this may

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.669 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that this is this may seem a better fit for for yeah

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:33.430 align:start position:0%
seem a better fit for for yeah this kind of

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.270 align:start position:0%
this kind of entities

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.710 align:start position:0%
entities stellar accounts you mean the the

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.070 align:start position:0%
stellar accounts you mean the the classic stellar accounts I yeah I

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.990 align:start position:0%
classic stellar accounts I yeah I suppose this is what you mean

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.750 align:start position:0%
suppose this is what you mean but yeah I a smart Don't

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:56.870 align:start position:0%
Yeah. Yeah. We have to give it a thought. But I I I

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.029 align:start position:0%
thought. But I I I think we can it can

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:04.789 align:start position:0%
think we can it can be disting distinguished well enough so

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
be disting distinguished well enough so not to be confused.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.710 align:start position:0%
not to be confused. It would be great to include a 15minute

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.950 align:start position:0%
It would be great to include a 15minute demo of building an actual d. Great

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.950 align:start position:0%
demo of building an actual d. Great suggestion. [laughter]

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
suggestion. [laughter] I'm taking it. taking it.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.590 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.909 align:start position:0%
Okay, then I'm passing it to to O.

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:32.310 align:start position:0%
I'm passing it to to O. &gt;&gt; Right.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.029 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hi again everyone. I'm going to be

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:36.789 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Hi again everyone. I'm going to be presenting

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
presenting the world token world and also RWA.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.149 align:start position:0%
the world token world and also RWA. So let me share the screen. Let's

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
So let me share the screen. Let's do entire screen.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.830 align:start position:0%
do entire screen. Please tell me if it's successful

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.029 align:start position:0%
Please tell me if it's successful because I don't see the

00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:58.149 align:start position:0%
because I don't see the streaming tab right now.

00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:01.269 align:start position:0%
streaming tab right now. &gt;&gt; Yep, we see we see your presentation.

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:04.310 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yep, we see we see your presentation. &gt;&gt; Great. Great.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Great. Great. Let's try slideshow.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.350 align:start position:0%
Let's try slideshow. So, what's it that I'm going to be

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.909 align:start position:0%
So, what's it that I'm going to be talking about? it's a uniform

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:16.549 align:start position:0%
talking about? it's a uniform interface for integrating with various

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:19.269 align:start position:0%
interface for integrating with various yield generating strategies also known

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:24.230 align:start position:0%
yield generating strategies also known as ERC 4626 if you are familiar with the

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.310 align:start position:0%
as ERC 4626 if you are familiar with the Athereum ecosystem.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
Athereum ecosystem. The problem tokold solving is let's say

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.630 align:start position:0%
The problem tokold solving is let's say you have a th00and USDC

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.190 align:start position:0%
you have a th00and USDC and what are you going to do with this?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.909 align:start position:0%
and what are you going to do with this? You can lend it, you can provide it for

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:39.750 align:start position:0%
You can lend it, you can provide it for liquidity

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.710 align:start position:0%
liquidity or you can stake it, right? but these

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
or you can stake it, right? but these are all the options you can do

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.549 align:start position:0%
are all the options you can do or you can have a manager of your funds

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
or you can have a manager of your funds for utilizing the best option out

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.710 align:start position:0%
for utilizing the best option out there. But

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.590 align:start position:0%
there. But for every manager you will have

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.710 align:start position:0%
for every manager you will have different problems. There is no

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.990 align:start position:0%
different problems. There is no interoperability. There is no

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.590 align:start position:0%
interoperability. There is no composibility.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.750 align:start position:0%
composibility. The UX in general would be bad.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.029 align:start position:0%
The UX in general would be bad. So, vault tries to standardize all these

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:19.029 align:start position:0%
So, vault tries to standardize all these and it still can be managed.

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
and it still can be managed. So, this is what we are trying to do.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
So, this is what we are trying to do. So, you deposit your assets into the

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.190 align:start position:0%
So, you deposit your assets into the world. The world tries to

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
world. The world tries to utilize your assets in the best way and

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
utilize your assets in the best way and earn some interest and you will get

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.230 align:start position:0%
earn some interest and you will get shares in return. And you can always

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.630 align:start position:0%
shares in return. And you can always do

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.590 align:start position:0%
do transitions between shares and

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.269 align:start position:0%
transitions between shares and assets. You can convert them

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:50.230 align:start position:0%
assets. You can convert them interchangeably.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
So how do we calculate shares and assets? So let's say you deposit your

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:58.789 align:start position:0%
assets? So let's say you deposit your assets and you will get shares. The

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
assets and you will get shares. The basic formula for that would be we

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
basic formula for that would be we will multiply the deposit assets by the

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.630 align:start position:0%
will multiply the deposit assets by the total shares currently in the world and

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.590 align:start position:0%
total shares currently in the world and then we divide the this result by total

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
then we divide the this result by total assets in the world and that whole

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.549 align:start position:0%
assets in the world and that whole result will be your shares.

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
result will be your shares. This will be very important. so now

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
This will be very important. so now that I'm going to do some basic math

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.830 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to do some basic math but it's very basic so don't be scared.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.230 align:start position:0%
but it's very basic so don't be scared. first action

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.830 align:start position:0%
first action Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.430 align:start position:0%
Say Alice deposits 100 USDC into the vault.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
vault. So for deposit assets it's th 100

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:41.110 align:start position:0%
So for deposit assets it's th 100 total shares it's again 100 and total

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
total shares it's again 100 and total assets is 100.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
assets is 100. So let's say 10% yield is earned

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
So let's say 10% yield is earned and now the asset amount per share has

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.750 align:start position:0%
and now the asset amount per share has increased. So previously one asset

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.350 align:start position:0%
increased. So previously one asset was corresponding to one share but

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.190 align:start position:0%
was corresponding to one share but right now

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
right now since the total shares have not changed

00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:10.950 align:start position:0%
since the total shares have not changed it only the interest rate increase the

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.350 align:start position:0%
it only the interest rate increase the total asset amount

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.830 align:start position:0%
total asset amount in the world

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
in the world then this ratio should change right

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
then this ratio should change right right now if you provide one share you

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
right now if you provide one share you will get 1.1 1 asset in return because

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.269 align:start position:0%
will get 1.1 1 asset in return because one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:36.310 align:start position:0%
one 10% of interest rate and now Bob say Bob deposits 300 USC

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.029 align:start position:0%
Bob deposits 300 USC and we do this calculation and Bob will

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:44.549 align:start position:0%
and we do this calculation and Bob will get will get 272.73

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.269 align:start position:0%
shares in return. So it's not one to one mapping as in the case for Alice

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:54.470 align:start position:0%
mapping as in the case for Alice because there was 10%. And this is still

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
because there was 10%. And this is still fine because if you multiply the

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.710 align:start position:0%
fine because if you multiply the shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.389 align:start position:0%
shares by 1.1 you will get 300. So it is still fair.

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
still fair. And let's say another 10% of interest

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.029 align:start position:0%
And let's say another 10% of interest has happened and now Charlie deposits

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:14.149 align:start position:0%
has happened and now Charlie deposits 200 and the amount for shares would be

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
200 and the amount for shares would be 165.

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:23.269 align:start position:0%
The problem is in this previous slide is we have

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:27.029 align:start position:0%
we have these decimals, right? this is not an

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.950 align:start position:0%
these decimals, right? this is not an integer but it's kind of a floating

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.710 align:start position:0%
integer but it's kind of a floating number. This is problematic because

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
number. This is problematic because how do you handle 3.33 shares for

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.630 align:start position:0%
how do you handle 3.33 shares for example? You cannot. So for shares

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.669 align:start position:0%
example? You cannot. So for shares we round up or down.

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.669 align:start position:0%
we round up or down. When we do we round down when do we

00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:49.990 align:start position:0%
When we do we round down when do we round up. So let's say you are minting

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.789 align:start position:0%
round up. So let's say you are minting or depositing depo depositing we are

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:55.190 align:start position:0%
or depositing depo depositing we are rounding down your number of shares so

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.310 align:start position:0%
rounding down your number of shares so that you'll get slightly fewer shares

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.190 align:start position:0%
that you'll get slightly fewer shares than the exact ratio. The reason is

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
than the exact ratio. The reason is world cannot overmint shares and we have

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.909 align:start position:0%
world cannot overmint shares and we have to provide we have to protect the

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
to provide we have to protect the world not the users so that attacks

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.070 align:start position:0%
world not the users so that attacks won't happen.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.630 align:start position:0%
won't happen. So this is the same this this

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.389 align:start position:0%
So this is the same this this rounding down goes for minting and

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:21.029 align:start position:0%
rounding down goes for minting and depositing and the opposite one rounding

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:23.909 align:start position:0%
depositing and the opposite one rounding up goes for redeem and withdraw

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:27.510 align:start position:0%
up goes for redeem and withdraw operations for gold

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.590 align:start position:0%
operations for gold which creates another problem which I

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
which creates another problem which I will demonstrate right now. Let's say

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
will demonstrate right now. Let's say okay this is the inflation attack.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.830 align:start position:0%
okay this is the inflation attack. There is couple of versions of it.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
There is couple of versions of it. let's say the attacker deposits one's

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
let's say the attacker deposits one's troop. So he minted a share

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.549 align:start position:0%
troop. So he minted a share and right now one share will correspond

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:51.430 align:start position:0%
and right now one share will correspond to one's troop only.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.909 align:start position:0%
to one's troop only. Then the keyword here is donates. It's

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
Then the keyword here is donates. It's not deposit. So since it's not deposit,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
not deposit. So since it's not deposit, it only increases the total asset amount

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
it only increases the total asset amount but not the shares. So it's basically

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.029 align:start position:0%
but not the shares. So it's basically I'm just giving away this money to the

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:07.350 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving away this money to the vault and I'm not expecting any shares

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.669 align:start position:0%
vault and I'm not expecting any shares in return. Why would someone do this?

00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:12.630 align:start position:0%
in return. Why would someone do this? You will see the reason. and if you

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.070 align:start position:0%
You will see the reason. and if you convert the USDC to stroops you know

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.710 align:start position:0%
convert the USDC to stroops you know there are seven decimal places in

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.230 align:start position:0%
there are seven decimal places in stellar so we added after 10,000 seven

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.510 align:start position:0%
stellar so we added after 10,000 seven more u zeros and then we added the

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
more u zeros and then we added the previous ones troop you will have this

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.549 align:start position:0%
previous ones troop you will have this number for total assets and now alice

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
number for total assets and now alice deposits

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
deposits thousands troops so if you divide

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.630 align:start position:0%
thousands troops so if you divide thousands troops to this total asset

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
thousands troops to this total asset amount

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.870 align:start position:0%
amount you will get something really small like

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.789 align:start position:0%
you will get something really small like 0.00001

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
0.00001 or something like that and this will be

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.750 align:start position:0%
or something like that and this will be ultimately zero because of the rounding

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
ultimately zero because of the rounding down that I explained previously. So

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
down that I explained previously. So basically Alice deposited some money

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.710 align:start position:0%
basically Alice deposited some money which which was non zero. It was

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.710 align:start position:0%
which which was non zero. It was thousands troops but in return she got

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.190 align:start position:0%
thousands troops but in return she got zero shares and if the attacker redeems

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.789 align:start position:0%
zero shares and if the attacker redeems their shares they will get all the money

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:17.509 align:start position:0%
their shares they will get all the money basically stealing Alice's troops.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:20.789 align:start position:0%
basically stealing Alice's troops. The other scenario would be in here. So

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:23.029 align:start position:0%
The other scenario would be in here. So let's say again this the first two

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
let's say again this the first two scenario are the same attacker deposited

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.430 align:start position:0%
scenario are the same attacker deposited one troop and then they donated 1 thou

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
one troop and then they donated 1 thou 10,000 USDC

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
10,000 USDC and after that say Alice deposited

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.950 align:start position:0%
and after that say Alice deposited 10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
10,000 USD so it's almost a half of the total assets right but only one stroop

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.029 align:start position:0%
total assets right but only one stroop short of it so if you do the calculation

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:48.310 align:start position:0%
short of it so if you do the calculation it will be somewhat like 0.99999

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.789 align:start position:0%
it will be somewhat like 0.99999 but since we don't have any precision

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:53.509 align:start position:0%
but since we don't have any precision for the decimal points, it will again be

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:57.509 align:start position:0%
for the decimal points, it will again be round down to zero and attacker would

00:32:57.519 --> 00:33:01.509 align:start position:0%
round down to zero and attacker would steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:04.389 align:start position:0%
steal all Alice's money like 10,000 USD due to this rounding down behavior.

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.149 align:start position:0%
due to this rounding down behavior. So this is the inflation attack. This is

00:33:06.159 --> 00:33:09.590 align:start position:0%
So this is the inflation attack. This is not only for our implementation. This

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.389 align:start position:0%
not only for our implementation. This attack existed through all ecosystems

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:15.029 align:start position:0%
attack existed through all ecosystems and fortunately we have a solution for

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
and fortunately we have a solution for that. The most common one is decimal

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.269 align:start position:0%
that. The most common one is decimal offset.

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
offset. So instead of this regular or the

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.990 align:start position:0%
So instead of this regular or the straightforward calculation we also add

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.070 align:start position:0%
straightforward calculation we also add an offset to the power of 10

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.389 align:start position:0%
an offset to the power of 10 and it will be something like this. So

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
and it will be something like this. So if you deposit one stroop instead of one

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
if you deposit one stroop instead of one share you will get

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.149 align:start position:0%
share you will get this amount of shares. this is up to

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:43.509 align:start position:0%
this amount of shares. this is up to your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:47.269 align:start position:0%
your decimal offset. So let's say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.990 align:start position:0%
4 5 6 7 8 9 and in this case you will have nine for the offset and you will

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.789 align:start position:0%
have nine for the offset and you will get this amount of shares

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:55.509 align:start position:0%
get this amount of shares and let's say for the same attack the

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:58.389 align:start position:0%
and let's say for the same attack the attacker then donates

00:33:58.399 --> 00:34:00.710 align:start position:0%
attacker then donates 10,000 USDC

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.070 align:start position:0%
10,000 USDC they won't get any shares because

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.909 align:start position:0%
they won't get any shares because it's a donation then Alice would deposit

00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:09.510 align:start position:0%
it's a donation then Alice would deposit 10,000 strooss it would have been this

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.310 align:start position:0%
10,000 strooss it would have been this small amount previously if we didn't use

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.550 align:start position:0%
small amount previously if we didn't use decimal offset but since we are using

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.669 align:start position:0%
decimal offset but since we are using decimal offset Alice will get one share

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
decimal offset Alice will get one share and attack won't be

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
and attack won't be attack won't resolve so basically

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.909 align:start position:0%
attack won't resolve so basically there is no attack due to this decimal

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:31.750 align:start position:0%
there is no attack due to this decimal offset

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:39.030 align:start position:0%
any questions about vault

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:46.869 align:start position:0%
and I will just stop presenting and we'll move on to RWA after

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to RWA after questions. By the way, maybe we can also

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.109 align:start position:0%
questions. By the way, maybe we can also share a link for the world implement.

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:56.550 align:start position:0%
share a link for the world implement. &gt;&gt; Yeah, just maybe we also want to

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just maybe we also want to shout to shout out to

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
shout to shout out to someone who helped contributed to the

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.150 align:start position:0%
someone who helped contributed to the implementation.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.990 align:start position:0%
implementation. I don't know if he's on the call, GS

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.030 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he's on the call, GS Maxi from Sentinel F. So yeah, he he

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.910 align:start position:0%
Maxi from Sentinel F. So yeah, he he helped with this implementation.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
helped with this implementation. Yeah,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.829 align:start position:0%
Yeah, &gt;&gt; laid the groundwork and we

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:25.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; laid the groundwork and we and he also helped us writing the SE

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
and he also helped us writing the SE for world. We just got merged today by

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
for world. We just got merged today by the way. so we have a new SE guys for

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.710 align:start position:0%
the way. so we have a new SE guys for the world. All right, great. Then I can

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
the world. All right, great. Then I can continue with RWA.

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:47.589 align:start position:0%
So for this one, I'm going to be presenting over some text instead of

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:51.589 align:start position:0%
presenting over some text instead of slides.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
Okay. , is the is it readable or should I make it

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.589 align:start position:0%
is it readable or should I make it bigger?

00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:00.550 align:start position:0%
bigger? &gt;&gt; , maybe just slightly bigger. Yeah, I

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; , maybe just slightly bigger. Yeah, I think this is good.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.510 align:start position:0%
think this is good. &gt;&gt; Great.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Great. So RWA as you know stands for real world

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.310 align:start position:0%
So RWA as you know stands for real world assets and it's more like a switch of

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.950 align:start position:0%
assets and it's more like a switch of contracts

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.829 align:start position:0%
contracts compared to a single contract. So it's

00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
compared to a single contract. So it's more complicated and involved for the

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.270 align:start position:0%
more complicated and involved for the base RWA token. You can think of it like

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
base RWA token. You can think of it like a funible token. It has the same

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
a funible token. It has the same metadata and core functions but on top

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.829 align:start position:0%
metadata and core functions but on top of that we have forced transfer which

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:39.190 align:start position:0%
of that we have forced transfer which the admins can force transfers on behalf

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.030 align:start position:0%
the admins can force transfers on behalf of the users. We have freezing both

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
of the users. We have freezing both address level and partial. Partial means

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.190 align:start position:0%
address level and partial. Partial means we can freeze some part of your wallet

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.750 align:start position:0%
we can freeze some part of your wallet balance. For example, maybe you have

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.550 align:start position:0%
balance. For example, maybe you have 2,000 in your balance and we only froze

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
2,000 in your balance and we only froze 500 of it. And address level is your

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
500 of it. And address level is your address is frozen for every like

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
address is frozen for every like transfer, mint, etc. operation. So

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.430 align:start position:0%
transfer, mint, etc. operation. So basically you are on hold.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.990 align:start position:0%
basically you are on hold. We do also provide recovery mechanisms

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.829 align:start position:0%
We do also provide recovery mechanisms in RWA.

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:17.829 align:start position:0%
in RWA. In case of you lose your private key

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:21.030 align:start position:0%
In case of you lose your private key then the authorities can recover your

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.349 align:start position:0%
then the authorities can recover your wallet by

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:26.630 align:start position:0%
wallet by sending your balance to another wallet

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.630 align:start position:0%
sending your balance to another wallet and also all the account related

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
and also all the account related information of you as well. for this

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.190 align:start position:0%
information of you as well. for this recovery of course you have to convince

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.589 align:start position:0%
recovery of course you have to convince the authorities by providing the

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
the authorities by providing the necessary documentation. It's not part

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.710 align:start position:0%
necessary documentation. It's not part of the RWA standard, but this is how it

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.470 align:start position:0%
of the RWA standard, but this is how it will work on behi behind the scenes.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
will work on behi behind the scenes. And you probably already know about

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.630 align:start position:0%
And you probably already know about pausible operations for

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.030 align:start position:0%
pausible operations for the utility for other tokens as well.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
the utility for other tokens as well. This is the same for RWA token. We can

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
This is the same for RWA token. We can pause the operations for the contract.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.030 align:start position:0%
pause the operations for the contract. So this base token contract is going to

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.030 align:start position:0%
So this base token contract is going to be interacting with two modules or

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.750 align:start position:0%
be interacting with two modules or stacks. One of them is identity, the

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.829 align:start position:0%
stacks. One of them is identity, the other one is compliance.

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
other one is compliance. Identity stack will be responsible from

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
Identity stack will be responsible from verifying your identity basically but

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.790 align:start position:0%
verifying your identity basically but it's also very involved and I will get

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.829 align:start position:0%
it's also very involved and I will get into details later. And the other one is

00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:26.950 align:start position:0%
into details later. And the other one is compliance. This is mostly for hooks

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.630 align:start position:0%
compliance. This is mostly for hooks post and pre hooks for the

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.550 align:start position:0%
post and pre hooks for the operations

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
operations and this is this exists mostly due to

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.910 align:start position:0%
and this is this exists mostly due to allow organizations or governments or

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.670 align:start position:0%
allow organizations or governments or etc to include or embed their own

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.190 align:start position:0%
etc to include or embed their own business logic into transfers and means

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.150 align:start position:0%
business logic into transfers and means and burn operations.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.550 align:start position:0%
and burn operations. So let's go step by step. the RWA

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
So let's go step by step. the RWA token as I told you is the main contract

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.990 align:start position:0%
token as I told you is the main contract and it

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.230 align:start position:0%
and it it communicates with compliance and

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.750 align:start position:0%
it communicates with compliance and identity verifier. The compliance is

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.990 align:start position:0%
identity verifier. The compliance is managing five hook types which I will

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.710 align:start position:0%
managing five hook types which I will dive further deep into.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.430 align:start position:0%
dive further deep into. And the good thing about compliance and

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
And the good thing about compliance and identity verifier is they are

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.670 align:start position:0%
identity verifier is they are multi-token support which means let's

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
multi-token support which means let's say you have a compliance contract you

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.030 align:start position:0%
say you have a compliance contract you can share this with multiple tokens

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
can share this with multiple tokens multiple RWA tokens. So let's say there

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.790 align:start position:0%
multiple RWA tokens. So let's say there is another RWA token here. It can also

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.430 align:start position:0%
is another RWA token here. It can also go to the same compliance contract. I

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.630 align:start position:0%
go to the same compliance contract. I will give this example which I like.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.910 align:start position:0%
will give this example which I like. Let's say you have bank A and bank B in

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.790 align:start position:0%
Let's say you have bank A and bank B in your country and since they are in the

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.790 align:start position:0%
your country and since they are in the same country probably the compliance

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.670 align:start position:0%
same country probably the compliance that they need to oblige to will be the

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.349 align:start position:0%
that they need to oblige to will be the same. So they can use the same

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:53.030 align:start position:0%
same. So they can use the same compliance in this case.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.030 align:start position:0%
compliance in this case. Identity verifier again this can be

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
Identity verifier again this can be shared across multiple tokens. it

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
shared across multiple tokens. it validates the identity of the

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.589 align:start position:0%
validates the identity of the investors of this

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.670 align:start position:0%
investors of this token.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.310 align:start position:0%
token. I will dive this into later. So let's

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.870 align:start position:0%
I will dive this into later. So let's skip for now.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.069 align:start position:0%
skip for now. If you go for the highle basics

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:19.270 align:start position:0%
If you go for the highle basics for the token you need to provide the

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
for the token you need to provide the name symbol decimals and initial supply

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.750 align:start position:0%
name symbol decimals and initial supply very standard basic stuff. Same with the

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
very standard basic stuff. Same with the funible

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.589 align:start position:0%
funible and on top of the funible we will have

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:31.589 align:start position:0%
and on top of the funible we will have the freezing mechanisms. We will have a

00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
the freezing mechanisms. We will have a recovery mechanism. We will have force

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.750 align:start position:0%
recovery mechanism. We will have force transfers and posible operations as I

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.510 align:start position:0%
transfers and posible operations as I told you.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.310 align:start position:0%
told you. So right now I already told about how

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
So right now I already told about how this compliance and identity stack can

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.150 align:start position:0%
this compliance and identity stack can be shared. So I'm going to skip this one

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.310 align:start position:0%
be shared. So I'm going to skip this one as well. So let's dive into identity

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.150 align:start position:0%
as well. So let's dive into identity stack.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.430 align:start position:0%
stack. So there can be multiple ways to verify

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.309 align:start position:0%
So there can be multiple ways to verify identity. The one we provide which is

00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:02.069 align:start position:0%
identity. The one we provide which is the default one is claim based. So

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:05.030 align:start position:0%
the default one is claim based. So you can think of it like I'm from Turkey

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.430 align:start position:0%
you can think of it like I'm from Turkey and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
and I'm a Turkish citizen and in this RWA setting maybe the residency is an

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
RWA setting maybe the residency is an issue. So I must have a claim from the

00:41:15.359 --> 00:41:18.870 align:start position:0%
issue. So I must have a claim from the authorities that I'm a resident

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
authorities that I'm a resident of Turkey. So I I need a residency

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.589 align:start position:0%
of Turkey. So I I need a residency claim issued for me by the authorities.

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.750 align:start position:0%
claim issued for me by the authorities. And one downside of this approach can be

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.710 align:start position:0%
And one downside of this approach can be if it is not encrypted

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.030 align:start position:0%
if it is not encrypted then all the data for everyone since

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.069 align:start position:0%
then all the data for everyone since this is onchain data can be seen by

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
this is onchain data can be seen by everyone. So this is very useful but

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.309 align:start position:0%
everyone. So this is very useful but also if you care about privacy it's it

00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:45.750 align:start position:0%
also if you care about privacy it's it may not be the best solution.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.069 align:start position:0%
may not be the best solution. so there are other approaches as well

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
so there are other approaches as well like you can do Merkel tree, you can

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.910 align:start position:0%
like you can do Merkel tree, you can do ZK email, you can do your own custom

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
do ZK email, you can do your own custom approach. We do not provide these by the

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.230 align:start position:0%
approach. We do not provide these by the way but they are for sure doable and we

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.030 align:start position:0%
way but they are for sure doable and we designed the architecture in such a way

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.430 align:start position:0%
designed the architecture in such a way that this coupling here is not tight

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.990 align:start position:0%
that this coupling here is not tight but loose. So you can easily plug plug

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.710 align:start position:0%
but loose. So you can easily plug plug this one out and plug your own solution

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.829 align:start position:0%
this one out and plug your own solution for identity stack. Sorry here. So

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:18.069 align:start position:0%
for identity stack. Sorry here. So basically you can replace the stack

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
basically you can replace the stack here and plug your own.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
So what do we provide for the default identity? We provide claim topics. These

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.109 align:start position:0%
identity? We provide claim topics. These will be non customer anti-manual

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:37.589 align:start position:0%
will be non customer anti-manual laundering etc. For the topics

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
laundering etc. For the topics we limited the topics by at most 15. We

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.870 align:start position:0%
we limited the topics by at most 15. We also have trusted issuers. these are

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.630 align:start position:0%
also have trusted issuers. these are all separate contracts by the way. Like

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.390 align:start position:0%
all separate contracts by the way. Like this is a separate contract. This is a

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.309 align:start position:0%
this is a separate contract. This is a separate contract. This is a separate

00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:52.309 align:start position:0%
separate contract. This is a separate contract.

00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:56.550 align:start position:0%
contract. And the issuers, the trusted issuers

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
And the issuers, the trusted issuers will be able to sign claims on behalf of

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.550 align:start position:0%
will be able to sign claims on behalf of the users so that the users can use

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
the users so that the users can use these claims.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
these claims. And

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
And we also store the information regarding

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.390 align:start position:0%
we also store the information regarding the identities like if they are

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.630 align:start position:0%
the identities like if they are individuals or organization

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
individuals or organization which country are they based in etc.

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:22.230 align:start position:0%
which country are they based in etc. So the identity stack is managing all

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.630 align:start position:0%
So the identity stack is managing all the claims and the

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.670 align:start position:0%
the claims and the topics and also the

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.589 align:start position:0%
topics and also the account related information like

00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
account related information like individual organization country

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
individual organization country information etc.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.309 align:start position:0%
information etc. the compliance one. So these are the

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:40.069 align:start position:0%
the compliance one. So these are the hooks. This is much more

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:43.750 align:start position:0%
hooks. This is much more straightforward. We have two pre hooks

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.270 align:start position:0%
straightforward. We have two pre hooks and three post hooks

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.270 align:start position:0%
and three post hooks transferred, created and destroyed. So I

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.109 align:start position:0%
transferred, created and destroyed. So I will start from the pre hooks.

00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
will start from the pre hooks. Say your organization needs to run

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.349 align:start position:0%
Say your organization needs to run additional business logic for transfers.

00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:01.589 align:start position:0%
additional business logic for transfers. So before any transfer operation

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:04.550 align:start position:0%
So before any transfer operation happens, you want to run some custom

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.510 align:start position:0%
happens, you want to run some custom business logic, you can do that. we

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.710 align:start position:0%
business logic, you can do that. we have a compliance contract which will

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
have a compliance contract which will call this hook when a transfer is about

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.870 align:start position:0%
call this hook when a transfer is about to happen. And for this hook to work,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
to happen. And for this hook to work, you can have your own contracts.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.470 align:start position:0%
you can have your own contracts. We will call them modules. [snorts] And

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.390 align:start position:0%
We will call them modules. [snorts] And let's say you have a module for can

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.750 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a module for can transfer. So what you would do is you

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.950 align:start position:0%
transfer. So what you would do is you would link the compliance contract to

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.349 align:start position:0%
would link the compliance contract to your can transfer module contract and

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:41.829 align:start position:0%
your can transfer module contract and this compliance contract will call your

00:44:41.839 --> 00:44:45.109 align:start position:0%
this compliance contract will call your module on every time there is a transfer

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:48.630 align:start position:0%
module on every time there is a transfer is about to happen and the good thing is

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.230 align:start position:0%
is about to happen and the good thing is you can deploy many contracts per one

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
you can deploy many contracts per one hook. So for example, you can have three

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
hook. So for example, you can have three contracts that will be called for can

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.950 align:start position:0%
contracts that will be called for can transfer but five for can create which

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.910 align:start position:0%
transfer but five for can create which for be minting. This is completely up to

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
for be minting. This is completely up to you. we decided to go with multiple

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.309 align:start position:0%
you. we decided to go with multiple contracts due to audit audit

00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:13.829 align:start position:0%
contracts due to audit audit auditability and also separation of

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:16.870 align:start position:0%
auditability and also separation of concerns. So if you just wrote your

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
concerns. So if you just wrote your logic into this scan transfer and then

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.950 align:start position:0%
logic into this scan transfer and then you wrote another logic in the scan

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.670 align:start position:0%
you wrote another logic in the scan transfer by pure code then it would be

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.990 align:start position:0%
transfer by pure code then it would be cumbersome to manage and debug. So

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.790 align:start position:0%
cumbersome to manage and debug. So that's why all business logics separated

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
that's why all business logics separated into their own contracts which will be

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.190 align:start position:0%
into their own contracts which will be called by a relayer contract or proxy

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
called by a relayer contract or proxy contract is a better architecture.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.670 align:start position:0%
contract is a better architecture. The same goes for these post hooks. You

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.990 align:start position:0%
The same goes for these post hooks. You can have additional logic for all of

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.670 align:start position:0%
can have additional logic for all of these.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
these. And that summarizes

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
And that summarizes the compliance module.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.910 align:start position:0%
the compliance module. So what about the access control? you

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.150 align:start position:0%
So what about the access control? you have few options. You can go with

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
have few options. You can go with ownership model or role based access

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.190 align:start position:0%
ownership model or role based access control. So it's completely up to you.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
control. So it's completely up to you. And for each kind of operation you can

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
And for each kind of operation you can assign roles have very complex role

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.790 align:start position:0%
assign roles have very complex role based access control architecture or

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
based access control architecture or very simple one again completely up to

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.829 align:start position:0%
very simple one again completely up to you.

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:20.630 align:start position:0%
you. We now only provide one extension for

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.082 align:start position:0%
We now only provide one extension for RWA which is document manager.

00:46:25.092 --> 00:46:27.349 align:start position:0%
RWA which is document manager. [clears throat] enables you to attach

00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:30.870 align:start position:0%
[clears throat] enables you to attach some legal documents etc to your token.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.790 align:start position:0%
some legal documents etc to your token. Of course, we do not store the whole

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.829 align:start position:0%
Of course, we do not store the whole document in the blockchain like onchain.

00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:37.430 align:start position:0%
document in the blockchain like onchain. This will be inefficient. We are

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.550 align:start position:0%
This will be inefficient. We are utilizing the hash.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.550 align:start position:0%
utilizing the hash. And you can also add your own extensions

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.790 align:start position:0%
And you can also add your own extensions to RWA.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.069 align:start position:0%
to RWA. That will be it for the RWA. If you have

00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
That will be it for the RWA. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.069 align:start position:0%
any questions, feel free to ask. I see one question. Is RWA design based

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:58.309 align:start position:0%
I see one question. Is RWA design based on any existing stars? Yeah, of course.

00:46:58.319 --> 00:47:06.150 align:start position:0%
on any existing stars? Yeah, of course. So we work with tokenia and ERC

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.270 align:start position:0%
So we work with tokenia and ERC foundation also in collaboration with

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.069 align:start position:0%
foundation also in collaboration with stellar included. So all these companies

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:15.990 align:start position:0%
stellar included. So all these companies came together and based on the RWA

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.349 align:start position:0%
came together and based on the RWA proposal for the Ethereum ecosystem

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:23.190 align:start position:0%
proposal for the Ethereum ecosystem or general ecosystem we made it specific

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
or general ecosystem we made it specific to Stellar. So we made some few

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
to Stellar. So we made some few deviations from the original proposal

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.309 align:start position:0%
deviations from the original proposal and most of our proposals to deviate

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
and most of our proposals to deviate from it

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.589 align:start position:0%
from it was welcomed and it will be adopted in

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:40.950 align:start position:0%
was welcomed and it will be adopted in the original standard as well. So we

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
the original standard as well. So we also contributed to the maturity of the

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.470 align:start position:0%
also contributed to the maturity of the original proposal as well. So it's not

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.990 align:start position:0%
original proposal as well. So it's not designed from scratch if that's what you

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.870 align:start position:0%
designed from scratch if that's what you are asking.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.829 align:start position:0%
are asking. &gt;&gt; Okay, great. This was three really

00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:55.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. This was three really interesting presentations and I think

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.190 align:start position:0%
interesting presentations and I think it's very aligned with what we see that

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.069 align:start position:0%
it's very aligned with what we see that developers are interested in doing.

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:05.829 align:start position:0%
developers are interested in doing. yeah the the

00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:10.069 align:start position:0%
yeah the the pass key integration and use that for

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:12.630 align:start position:0%
pass key integration and use that for authorization is something that's

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.349 align:start position:0%
authorization is something that's very big focus on I think this framework

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.589 align:start position:0%
very big focus on I think this framework you presented is going to help a lot of

00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:21.270 align:start position:0%
you presented is going to help a lot of developers to create a robust

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
developers to create a robust framework for for authorization using

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.069 align:start position:0%
framework for for authorization using pass keys the vault is something

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:29.030 align:start position:0%
pass keys the vault is something we've seen an increased interest in a

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.750 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increased interest in a lot of developers want to build in a way

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.230 align:start position:0%
lot of developers want to build in a way to earn for the tokens that the the

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
to earn for the tokens that the the users are are holding in their wallet.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.549 align:start position:0%
users are are holding in their wallet. So very interesting as well and RWA it's

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.950 align:start position:0%
So very interesting as well and RWA it's also super aligned with what what SDF is

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.950 align:start position:0%
also super aligned with what what SDF is interested in. So I think this is a

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.109 align:start position:0%
interested in. So I think this is a really this really hits right where the

00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:51.990 align:start position:0%
really this really hits right where the focus is from developer sites today. So

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.549 align:start position:0%
focus is from developer sites today. So super interesting and I think we we did

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:57.270 align:start position:0%
super interesting and I think we we did post all of the links but but otherwise

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.829 align:start position:0%
post all of the links but but otherwise go to opensein.org

00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:03.430 align:start position:0%
go to opensein.org orc I believe

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
orc I believe .com and and then then you can you

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.230 align:start position:0%
.com and and then then you can you can also see all the documentation

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.910 align:start position:0%
can also see all the documentation there. let's see was one more

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.829 align:start position:0%
there. let's see was one more comment.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.030 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I don't think there's any any other questions. this is last chance

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.589 align:start position:0%
other questions. this is last chance if anyone has a question but but thank

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:25.589 align:start position:0%
if anyone has a question but but thank you both of you for for joining today.

some of the tooling when we go out to hackathons and when we talk to

00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
hackathons and when we talk to developers that we see that they're

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
developers that we see that they're being used. I think that's that's the
