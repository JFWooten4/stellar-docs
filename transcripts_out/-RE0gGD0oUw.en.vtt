00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.510 align:start position:0%
okay let's get started so welcome everyone this is a soroban design

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.950 align:start position:0%
everyone this is a soroban design discussion in these meetings we

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.470 align:start position:0%
discussion in these meetings we discuss some of the core decisions

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.089 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the core decisions that we need to make when we're building

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.549 align:start position:0%
that we need to make when we're building soroban which is a platform for smart

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.970 align:start position:0%
soroban which is a platform for smart contracts that is in active

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590 align:start position:0%
contracts that is in active development right now and is being

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.250 align:start position:0%
development right now and is being integrated integrated with stellar

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.189 align:start position:0%
integrated integrated with stellar today we're talking about off next which

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.609 align:start position:0%
today we're talking about off next which is a proposal that Dima put together

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.970 align:start position:0%
is a proposal that Dima put together to address some of our authentication

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.370 align:start position:0%
to address some of our authentication and authorization needs on the network

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.889 align:start position:0%
and authorization needs on the network so I think that without further Ado

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.549 align:start position:0%
so I think that without further Ado this is the second time we're talking

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 align:start position:0%
this is the second time we're talking about off next the first time was before

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.250 align:start position:0%
about off next the first time was before the holidays a lot of folks were were

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770 align:start position:0%
the holidays a lot of folks were were were out so I think we're gonna start

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.970 align:start position:0%
were out so I think we're gonna start with an overview by Dima then dive

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
with an overview by Dima then dive into questions

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.549 align:start position:0%
into questions and ideally you will be able to make

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 align:start position:0%
and ideally you will be able to make a decision or get close we would

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 align:start position:0%
a decision or get close we would close without decision today so Dima

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.969 align:start position:0%
close without decision today so Dima can you take it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
can you take it yeah hi everyone you hear me

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.690 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay sounds good thank you so a quick overview I will

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.690 align:start position:0%
so a quick overview I will probably skip on the motivation for the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.870 align:start position:0%
probably skip on the motivation for the sake of time I will just say that the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.010 align:start position:0%
sake of time I will just say that the general modulation is that we are aren't

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.249 align:start position:0%
general modulation is that we are aren't too excited about the state the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 align:start position:0%
too excited about the state the others currently now it's a bit too

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.929 align:start position:0%
others currently now it's a bit too fragmented and to limit it in some

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
fragmented and to limit it in some senses well it's too flexible in other

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.490 align:start position:0%
senses well it's too flexible in other cases and it's not necessary so this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.789 align:start position:0%
cases and it's not necessary so this proposal tries to build something into

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.530 align:start position:0%
proposal tries to build something into the protocol

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.310 align:start position:0%
the protocol that would be those flexible but

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.370 align:start position:0%
that would be those flexible but also standardized so that contracts can

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.210 align:start position:0%
also standardized so that contracts can inter operate and the client software

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.810 align:start position:0%
inter operate and the client software can Implement certain things just once

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.029 align:start position:0%
can Implement certain things just once without tweaking them for every contract

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.690 align:start position:0%
without tweaking them for every contract so on a high level The Proposal consists

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.369 align:start position:0%
so on a high level The Proposal consists of

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.610 align:start position:0%
of two big components the first being

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.309 align:start position:0%
two big components the first being account abstraction and second being

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.670 align:start position:0%
account abstraction and second being standardized signature payloads and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650 align:start position:0%
standardized signature payloads and invocation authorization

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.250 align:start position:0%
invocation authorization so to play on this point account

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.750 align:start position:0%
so to play on this point account abstraction is a well-known concept on

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.010 align:start position:0%
abstraction is a well-known concept on in other chains and basically is that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.910 align:start position:0%
in other chains and basically is that instead of passing some entities that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.550 align:start position:0%
instead of passing some entities that are tied to some

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.369 align:start position:0%
are tied to some crypto algorithms such as

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
crypto algorithms such as some public keys or something like that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.229 align:start position:0%
some public keys or something like that or instead of trying all those to say

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
or instead of trying all those to say classic server accounts

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.449 align:start position:0%
classic server accounts we make the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.509 align:start position:0%
we make the contracts to operate on some abstract

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.869 align:start position:0%
contracts to operate on some abstract entities called accounts and from the

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.410 align:start position:0%
entities called accounts and from the contraction Point account is just an

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.130 align:start position:0%
contraction Point account is just an object that has an address that can be

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.830 align:start position:0%
object that has an address that can be used to throw balances for example or

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.930 align:start position:0%
used to throw balances for example or for any account related information or

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.830 align:start position:0%
for any account related information or transfer balances to this account

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.570 align:start position:0%
transfer balances to this account and it has a way to authorize the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.570 align:start position:0%
and it has a way to authorize the invocations of the functions it's not

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.509 align:start position:0%
invocations of the functions it's not the contract in the contract business

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.509 align:start position:0%
the contract in the contract business logic how exactly the account does that

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.930 align:start position:0%
logic how exactly the account does that so hence the abstraction and the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.330 align:start position:0%
so hence the abstraction and the accounts themselves can be implemented

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.809 align:start position:0%
accounts themselves can be implemented both in a built-in fashion some of our

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
both in a built-in fashion some of our built-in tokens and the building

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.369 align:start position:0%
built-in tokens and the building implementation will cover the classic

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.550 align:start position:0%
implementation will cover the classic store account so they will all get their

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.390 align:start position:0%
store account so they will all get their default account contract right but they

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.309 align:start position:0%
default account contract right but they also can be customized right for example

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.470 align:start position:0%
also can be customized right for example if someone comes up is a new

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.970 align:start position:0%
if someone comes up is a new cryptogram like this Quantum resistance

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.610 align:start position:0%
cryptogram like this Quantum resistance for example right or you know there are

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.530 align:start position:0%
for example right or you know there are Hardware votes that currently don't

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.050 align:start position:0%
Hardware votes that currently don't support her at all it is possible to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.630 align:start position:0%
support her at all it is possible to write an account contract that will

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.929 align:start position:0%
write an account contract that will perform this custom authentication but

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.610 align:start position:0%
perform this custom authentication but the possibilities are much better than

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.250 align:start position:0%
the possibilities are much better than that it is possible to have a literally

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.430 align:start position:0%
that it is possible to have a literally complex multi-6 schemes that are

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.850 align:start position:0%
complex multi-6 schemes that are probably currently not possible the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.710 align:start position:0%
probably currently not possible the class Explorer accounts for example it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.230 align:start position:0%
class Explorer accounts for example it is possible to record different mode

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
is possible to record different mode async

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
async [Music]

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.469 align:start position:0%
[Music] or different tokens spent or different

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.830 align:start position:0%
or different tokens spent or different balances spent basically this is a smart

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.170 align:start position:0%
balances spent basically this is a smart contract I guess that's the bottom line

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.330 align:start position:0%
contract I guess that's the bottom line of it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.430 align:start position:0%
of it so yeah this is the first component

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.170 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is the first component and the second component is

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
and the second component is about the signature payloads because

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.749 align:start position:0%
about the signature payloads because again currently signature pivot system

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.689 align:start position:0%
again currently signature pivot system of preform we have like the SDK

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.909 align:start position:0%
of preform we have like the SDK implementation of some structured

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.490 align:start position:0%
implementation of some structured payloads but this is just in one SDK

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
payloads but this is just in one SDK it's not 600 days in any way

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.330 align:start position:0%
it's not 600 days in any way so the proposal here is that instead

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.129 align:start position:0%
so the proposal here is that instead of

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.890 align:start position:0%
of relying on contracts to Define their own

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.770 align:start position:0%
relying on contracts to Define their own signatures schema

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.409 align:start position:0%
signatures schema we provide the generic ones that should

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.170 align:start position:0%
we provide the generic ones that should hopefully be flexible enough to keep all

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.249 align:start position:0%
hopefully be flexible enough to keep all the use cases

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
the use cases so

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.830 align:start position:0%
so the payload obviously would include some

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.409 align:start position:0%
the payload obviously would include some context information such as network

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.050 align:start position:0%
context information such as network ID but the main thing and the main

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.310 align:start position:0%
ID but the main thing and the main Innovation here is that instead of just

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.510 align:start position:0%
Innovation here is that instead of just signing a single contract call

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.909 align:start position:0%
signing a single contract call it is possible to sign a whole tree of

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.890 align:start position:0%
it is possible to sign a whole tree of course or even like Forest of trees

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
course or even like Forest of trees nature okay

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.170 align:start position:0%
basically from the contract standpoint when the

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.330 align:start position:0%
from the contract standpoint when the contract requires an account to

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.110 align:start position:0%
contract requires an account to authorize family vacation

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.749 align:start position:0%
authorize family vacation the Urban cost like the power wheel

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.710 align:start position:0%
the Urban cost like the power wheel

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.370 align:start position:0%
add this into a post deck of all Trace calls and build a context Tower so

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.370 align:start position:0%
calls and build a context Tower so basically when authorized this code from

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.129 align:start position:0%
basically when authorized this code from some contract the

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.510 align:start position:0%
some contract the payload for this call should contain

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.090 align:start position:0%
payload for this call should contain obviously the currently executed

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.430 align:start position:0%
obviously the currently executed Contracting function but also the call

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.590 align:start position:0%
Contracting function but also the call stack of the authorized invocations

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.350 align:start position:0%
stack of the authorized invocations leading to it and the contract provided

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.930 align:start position:0%
leading to it and the contract provided arguments so basically it's only since a

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.350 align:start position:0%
arguments so basically it's only since a contract needs to provide these

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
contract needs to provide these arguments for the authorization and

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
arguments for the authorization and everything else is inferred

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.330 align:start position:0%
everything else is inferred automatically based on the current

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.909 align:start position:0%
automatically based on the current Coast Tech and stuff like that

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
Coast Tech and stuff like that

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.030 align:start position:0%
The Proposal also includes

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.330 align:start position:0%
includes [Music]

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
[Music] that generalized Finance Management okay

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.590 align:start position:0%
that generalized Finance Management okay I think we wanted today different this

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
I think we wanted today different this but for the sake of overview ready is

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.129 align:start position:0%
but for the sake of overview ready is that

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
that cost will contain we will manage

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.790 align:start position:0%
cost will contain we will manage nonsense per contract and per account

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.170 align:start position:0%
nonsense per contract and per account address so that basically neither

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.749 align:start position:0%
address so that basically neither regular contracts nor account contracts

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.330 align:start position:0%
regular contracts nor account contracts need to worry about that and this comes

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.570 align:start position:0%
need to worry about that and this comes with some benefits like nouns can be

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.129 align:start position:0%
with some benefits like nouns can be consumed only for the top level

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
consumed only for the top level invocation and not any subsequence of

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.350 align:start position:0%
invocation and not any subsequence of contract calls

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.029 align:start position:0%
contract calls

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.670 align:start position:0%
plus Ledger access and more flexibility for the users

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.189 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the users that's rather benefits

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.529 align:start position:0%
that's rather benefits uploaded so now

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:58.969 align:start position:0%
uploaded so now

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.170 align:start position:0%
so these are two key Concepts and I think another interesting high level

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.909 align:start position:0%
I think another interesting high level point is that

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:12.129 align:start position:0%
point is that things housing is Paradise

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
things housing is Paradise for the cases of complex contracts

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.150 align:start position:0%
for the cases of complex contracts PreFlight can be utilized

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.650 align:start position:0%
PreFlight can be utilized to build this the signature payloads

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.650 align:start position:0%
to build this the signature payloads this is like like when we are talking

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
this is like like when we are talking about the contracts that have more than

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.969 align:start position:0%
about the contracts that have more than a single signature like it's a current

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.190 align:start position:0%
a single signature like it's a current world or modern single authorized and

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.310 align:start position:0%
world or modern single authorized and location it's a house next World

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.230 align:start position:0%
location it's a house next World it may be tricky to figure out like

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.050 align:start position:0%
it may be tricky to figure out like what exactly needs to be signed like

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.449 align:start position:0%
what exactly needs to be signed like the contract may be delegated to some

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.550 align:start position:0%
the contract may be delegated to some contracts that dynamically depends on

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.389 align:start position:0%
contracts that dynamically depends on their input and things like that so

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:54.170 align:start position:0%
their input and things like that so in order to figure out

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.389 align:start position:0%
in order to figure out what exactly needs to be signed in

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:58.250 align:start position:0%
what exactly needs to be signed in order to be able to execute a certain

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.470 align:start position:0%
order to be able to execute a certain contract call

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.269 align:start position:0%
contract call we introduce a mechanism in

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.570 align:start position:0%
we introduce a mechanism in pre-flight that we'll basically Trace

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.790 align:start position:0%
pre-flight that we'll basically Trace those authorization calls and build the

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.190 align:start position:0%
those authorization calls and build the proper payload

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.610 align:start position:0%
proper payload and the cool thing here is that this

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.949 align:start position:0%
and the cool thing here is that this stage like there is no signatures

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:19.070 align:start position:0%
stage like there is no signatures participating and basically no no

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.350 align:start position:0%
participating and basically no no commitment to any security reasons from

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.350 align:start position:0%
commitment to any security reasons from the user so the only thing that the

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.050 align:start position:0%
the user so the only thing that the private needs is the other addresses of

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.490 align:start position:0%
private needs is the other addresses of the account that participate in the

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
the account that participate in the invocation

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.690 align:start position:0%
what else

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's pretty much it on the high level

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.449 align:start position:0%
the high level [Music]

00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:42.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.269 align:start position:0%
I just think quite like so there's a bunch of other things but I think we

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:50.769 align:start position:0%
bunch of other things but I think we would want to look

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:52.670 align:start position:0%
would want to look yeah I think that's a great starting

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.230 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a great starting point and we can open it up for

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.530 align:start position:0%
point and we can open it up for questions I'm especially interested in

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.949 align:start position:0%
questions I'm especially interested in the perspective of the DAP developer so

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:03.769 align:start position:0%
the perspective of the DAP developer so Paul if you have any comments there I

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:06.230 align:start position:0%
Paul if you have any comments there I think that the original auth that we

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.829 align:start position:0%
think that the original auth that we built or what we now call Advanced off

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:11.690 align:start position:0%
built or what we now call Advanced off the the point in which we realized it

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.230 align:start position:0%
the the point in which we realized it was a bit problematic is when we had you

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.090 align:start position:0%
was a bit problematic is when we had you know daps and walls try to implement it

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.550 align:start position:0%
know daps and walls try to implement it and it became clear that it's you know

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.949 align:start position:0%
and it became clear that it's you know it's a lot to handle so I'm really

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:24.650 align:start position:0%
it's a lot to handle so I'm really interested to hear about this one in

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.850 align:start position:0%
interested to hear about this one in that perspective foreign

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.050 align:start position:0%
that perspective foreign talk a little bit more about what

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about what actually goes into the signature payload

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.690 align:start position:0%
actually goes into the signature payload specifically like do wallets have to

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
specifically like do wallets have to sign

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.910 align:start position:0%
sign only the sub tree sections were like

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.130 align:start position:0%
only the sub tree sections were like account the authorized is called or they

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
account the authorized is called or they have to sign every like cross-contract

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.389 align:start position:0%
have to sign every like cross-contract call or

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:49.690 align:start position:0%
call or yeah yeah as I've mentioned basically

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.110 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah as I've mentioned basically their trees over the coast not to

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
their trees over the coast not to exit full trees or whatever as a

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.250 align:start position:0%
exit full trees or whatever as a contract calls

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.150 align:start position:0%
contract calls

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.590 align:start position:0%
basically this is a subset of the whole country of the

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.130 align:start position:0%
subset of the whole country of the contract were the

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.470 align:start position:0%
contract were the current account oh not currently there

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
current account oh not currently there can't be interested in all Traders

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.910 align:start position:0%
can't be interested in all Traders something so let's say we have an

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.710 align:start position:0%
something so let's say we have an account a that once so sorry we have

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
account a that once so sorry we have a contract is that once the user to

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.389 align:start position:0%
a contract is that once the user to authorize it then it delegates to

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:28.250 align:start position:0%
authorize it then it delegates to contract BS that doesn't touch right

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
contract BS that doesn't touch right they return Then B code CZ that's

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.210 align:start position:0%
they return Then B code CZ that's authorize the users and that cost tags

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.329 align:start position:0%
authorize the users and that cost tags are user Sciences a and then C B will be

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:38.690 align:start position:0%
are user Sciences a and then C B will be omitted so you know there is no yes

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
omitted so you know there is no yes there is no time in a sense for all well

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.449 align:start position:0%
there is no time in a sense for all well it seems much more flexible right yeah

00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
it seems much more flexible right yeah that's okay so I feel like a exchange

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.889 align:start position:0%
that's okay so I feel like a exchange swap for example you would really only

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:51.650 align:start position:0%
swap for example you would really only have to sign like the token withdrawal

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.150 align:start position:0%
have to sign like the token withdrawal from your wallet

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
from your wallet yes sir like basically yeah you need to

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
yes sir like basically yeah you need to still approve your token to some router

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.650 align:start position:0%
still approve your token to some router contract and then router contract can

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.230 align:start position:0%
contract and then router contract can route your token in any direction or

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.310 align:start position:0%
route your token in any direction or vice versa like you may sign like some

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.590 align:start position:0%
vice versa like you may sign like some low levels of operation that just swaps

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.269 align:start position:0%
low levels of operation that just swaps you with someone and you don't really

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.069 align:start position:0%
you with someone and you don't really care how exactly this is being routed

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:14.569 align:start position:0%
care how exactly this is being routed again your signature is required under

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:17.150 align:start position:0%
again your signature is required under this bottom level operation so both ways

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.069 align:start position:0%
this bottom level operation so both ways work and also an important note on

00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:20.750 align:start position:0%
work and also an important note on signatures

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.150 align:start position:0%
signatures that I haven't mentioned is that

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.269 align:start position:0%
that I haven't mentioned is that wallets would sign the hash of the whole

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:29.569 align:start position:0%
wallets would sign the hash of the whole payload and this is mostly for the sake

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:31.730 align:start position:0%
payload and this is mostly for the sake of compatibility it's whatever hard of

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.850 align:start position:0%
of compatibility it's whatever hard of our wallets and possible features

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.329 align:start position:0%
our wallets and possible features basically we want to bound their

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
basically we want to bound their signature pivot size

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
signature pivot size like the actual signature go outside

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.310 align:start position:0%
like the actual signature go outside it's not premature yeah so the

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.110 align:start position:0%
it's not premature yeah so the wallets take the entire subtree hash

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
wallets take the entire subtree hash that then sign that so there's only one

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.690 align:start position:0%
that then sign that so there's only one second sure okay cool thank you yes

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
second sure okay cool thank you yes Dima yeah yeah I have a question about

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.069 align:start position:0%
Dima yeah yeah I have a question about and I'm going to steal a list questions

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:07.970 align:start position:0%
What What In the case that you want to pass an invalid signature one of the

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.690 align:start position:0%
pass an invalid signature one of the subcontact with the purpose of taking a

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.509 align:start position:0%
subcontact with the purpose of taking a different path in the in the contact

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
different path in the in the contact execution

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.009 align:start position:0%
execution right and explicitly you want to fail

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:20.930 align:start position:0%
right and explicitly you want to fail one of them

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.290 align:start position:0%
one of them yeah this is here okay so like I mean

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.190 align:start position:0%
yeah this is here okay so like I mean I'm interested to see like an actual

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
I'm interested to see like an actual use case for that because

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.970 align:start position:0%
use case for that because

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.690 align:start position:0%
from there like this only influences pre-flight right from the preference

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.310 align:start position:0%
pre-flight right from the preference standpoint like I describe this feature

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.350 align:start position:0%
standpoint like I describe this feature where we can record the authorizations

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.170 align:start position:0%
where we can record the authorizations but the side effect of recording them is

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.530 align:start position:0%
but the side effect of recording them is that we treat them all as successful

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.050 align:start position:0%
that we treat them all as successful it is not impossible to mock failures

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
it is not impossible to mock failures in the preferred API it's like basically

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.329 align:start position:0%
in the preferred API it's like basically not a protocol change I'm not convinced

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:55.430 align:start position:0%
not a protocol change I'm not convinced this is something we actually should do

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.769 align:start position:0%
this is something we actually should do and it's really unclear to me

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:03.530 align:start position:0%
and it's really unclear to me why would you ever want this to be the

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.750 align:start position:0%
why would you ever want this to be the game basically in my mind like if

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.050 align:start position:0%
game basically in my mind like if it's fine for the authorization failures

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.269 align:start position:0%
it's fine for the authorization failures to be recoverable

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.889 align:start position:0%
to be recoverable for example you know you want to

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:18.590 align:start position:0%
for example you know you want to clear like multiple trades and at once

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.829 align:start position:0%
clear like multiple trades and at once and in a general case trades may not

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:24.290 align:start position:0%
and in a general case trades may not clear for multitude of reasons one of

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.850 align:start position:0%
clear for multitude of reasons one of them being that signatures for the

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.190 align:start position:0%
them being that signatures for the trades for this trade are incorrect

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.350 align:start position:0%
trades for this trade are incorrect and you don't want for example to fail

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.090 align:start position:0%
and you don't want for example to fail other trades if you're just patching

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.490 align:start position:0%
other trades if you're just patching things together right this is a fair

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
things together right this is a fair case but I think this case is only

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.350 align:start position:0%
case but I think this case is only meaningful during the on-chain execution

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.610 align:start position:0%
meaningful during the on-chain execution

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:47.569 align:start position:0%
I think it is fine for the pre-flight for example to execute the hate this

00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:51.170 align:start position:0%
for example to execute the hate this scenario because it will be probably

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.110 align:start position:0%
scenario because it will be probably it will consume more gas and build

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.990 align:start position:0%
it will consume more gas and build access knowledge your entries than do

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
access knowledge your entries than do it in case of failure so it will make it

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.090 align:start position:0%
it in case of failure so it will make it superset of what is executed in chain

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.829 align:start position:0%
superset of what is executed in chain of course it is possible to write

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:07.069 align:start position:0%
of course it is possible to write some really weird contract Logics

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:09.530 align:start position:0%
some really weird contract Logics that would try to reorder trace the

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.110 align:start position:0%
that would try to reorder trace the account but again I'm not quite

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.829 align:start position:0%
account but again I'm not quite convinced that ever a good idea and

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.449 align:start position:0%
convinced that ever a good idea and there won't be a good support for that

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:18.949 align:start position:0%
there won't be a good support for that from the pre-flight standpoint for

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:19.970 align:start position:0%
from the pre-flight standpoint for example

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.210 align:start position:0%
example and but but I think there is a pretty

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.710 align:start position:0%
and but but I think there is a pretty good reason to not support it because

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.750 align:start position:0%
good reason to not support it because you kind of have this recursive

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.389 align:start position:0%
you kind of have this recursive dependency where like you want your

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
dependency where like you want your signatures to depend on the function

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.650 align:start position:0%
signatures to depend on the function input but then if your signature

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.470 align:start position:0%
input but then if your signature defines like what the signature should

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.810 align:start position:0%
defines like what the signature should be you get this basically cyclic

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.850 align:start position:0%
be you get this basically cyclic dependency rate

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.970 align:start position:0%
dependency rate so I I'm not convinced this is a good

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.550 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not convinced this is a good idea basically like

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.670 align:start position:0%
idea basically like what I would want contracts to do

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.829 align:start position:0%
what I would want contracts to do normally is that

00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:57.170 align:start position:0%
normally is that if you call contracts function with

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.389 align:start position:0%
if you call contracts function with certain arguments it comes with a

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:01.850 align:start position:0%
certain arguments it comes with a certain signature preload and this

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.650 align:start position:0%
certain signature preload and this relationship should be deterministic

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.490 align:start position:0%
relationship should be deterministic right and it should not involve

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.230 align:start position:0%
right and it should not involve signatures in the input

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.629 align:start position:0%
signatures in the input which is actually one of the problems

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.670 align:start position:0%
which is actually one of the problems with the current Advanced awesome

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.329 align:start position:0%
with the current Advanced awesome because we are like

00:16:16.339 --> 00:16:19.189 align:start position:0%
because we are like are we used to like include some

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:22.009 align:start position:0%
are we used to like include some information from the signatures while

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:24.050 align:start position:0%
information from the signatures while building pillows for another signatures

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.129 align:start position:0%
building pillows for another signatures and it's pretty messy and how to

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:31.610 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty messy and how to painting and power so yeah

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.449 align:start position:0%
painting and power so yeah yeah and another question this change

00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:37.810 align:start position:0%
yeah and another question this change implies that you need to do the

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.189 align:start position:0%
implies that you need to do the cryptographic verification

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.110 align:start position:0%
cryptographic verification posts

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.930 align:start position:0%
posts transaction execution right are they

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.449 align:start position:0%
transaction execution right are they very end right because you need to build

00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
very end right because you need to build the pre-image and in order to build a

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.889 align:start position:0%
the pre-image and in order to build a pre-image you need to run

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:56.090 align:start position:0%
pre-image you need to run the contact right so not on the simulate

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.189 align:start position:0%
the contact right so not on the simulate side but when you actually go and

00:16:58.199 --> 00:16:59.930 align:start position:0%
side but when you actually go and execute it

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
execute it you need to run the entire smart contact

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.350 align:start position:0%
you need to run the entire smart contact three right and only at the end you have

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
three right and only at the end you have the pre-image that you can verify with

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.169 align:start position:0%
the pre-image that you can verify with signature that's actually not true right

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:14.329 align:start position:0%
signature that's actually not true right like it's a bit of an implementation

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.569 align:start position:0%
like it's a bit of an implementation detail and I think it may change but in

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.970 align:start position:0%
detail and I think it may change but in the current prototype

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.350 align:start position:0%
the current prototype what happens is that since we kind of

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.510 align:start position:0%
what happens is that since we kind of decouple authentication and

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.330 align:start position:0%
decouple authentication and naturalization

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
well at first the whole tree has to be passed

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
be passed in some way along the transaction right

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.850 align:start position:0%
in some way along the transaction right so the transaction should know in the

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.190 align:start position:0%
so the transaction should know in the first place whatever if you are claiming

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.750 align:start position:0%
first place whatever if you are claiming you have time

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.810 align:start position:0%
you have time so from the smartphone perspective for

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.850 align:start position:0%
so from the smartphone perspective for example it's possible to examine the

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.750 align:start position:0%
example it's possible to examine the whole tree that's trying to or trades

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.070 align:start position:0%
whole tree that's trying to or trades from the authentication perspectives

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.650 align:start position:0%
from the authentication perspectives there is just this curved payload which

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.049 align:start position:0%
there is just this curved payload which is the hash of something and from the

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
is the hash of something and from the authentication standpoints the only

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.770 align:start position:0%
authentication standpoints the only thing we need to do to it is to

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.830 align:start position:0%
thing we need to do to it is to basically verify the signature of this

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
basically verify the signature of this payload is correct and in case of

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.470 align:start position:0%
payload is correct and in case of mounted sync accounts find all the

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
mounted sync accounts find all the signers right

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.029 align:start position:0%
signers right so basically the current

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.529 align:start position:0%
so basically the current implementation the authentication

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:20.930 align:start position:0%
implementation the authentication happens so easily the first time the

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.870 align:start position:0%
happens so easily the first time the account writes to trade something

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.630 align:start position:0%
account writes to trade something and actually the same goes to

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.150 align:start position:0%
and actually the same goes to evaluating the whole tree over the

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.490 align:start position:0%
evaluating the whole tree over the course in the vote like the latter part

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.190 align:start position:0%
course in the vote like the latter part may I may not change but I think yeah

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.970 align:start position:0%
may I may not change but I think yeah there is really no need to do anything

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.950 align:start position:0%
there is really no need to do anything until the end of the contract execution

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.230 align:start position:0%
until the end of the contract execution we just

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.029 align:start position:0%
we just do verification as soon as possible

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.770 align:start position:0%
do verification as soon as possible so basically

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.590 align:start position:0%
so basically you've like

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.970 align:start position:0%
you've like if Thompson is not like if some were

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.470 align:start position:0%
if Thompson is not like if some were deep in the subject there is a cause

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.810 align:start position:0%
deep in the subject there is a cause that hasn't been authorized will find

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.090 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been authorized will find out about it as soon as we reach this

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.529 align:start position:0%
out about it as soon as we reach this point but not

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.970 align:start position:0%
I see so the entire tree is effectively submitted as part of the transaction

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.390 align:start position:0%
submitted as part of the transaction right yeah it is and yeah I have seen

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
right yeah it is and yeah I have seen your suggestion on the dog that maybe

00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:16.190 align:start position:0%
your suggestion on the dog that maybe instead of passing like the whole show

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.250 align:start position:0%
instead of passing like the whole show explicitly we made Parts ashes of its

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.190 align:start position:0%
explicitly we made Parts ashes of its nodes which probably may be fine in

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.409 align:start position:0%
nodes which probably may be fine in terms of the transaction sites but yeah

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
terms of the transaction sites but yeah it really only matters for the

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.210 align:start position:0%
it really only matters for the transaction part of the things

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.810 align:start position:0%
transaction part of the things not for the actual execution yeah so

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
not for the actual execution yeah so my concern here is that people are going

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.710 align:start position:0%
my concern here is that people are going to use

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.510 align:start position:0%
to use the existing contact a

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.250 align:start position:0%
the existing contact a infrastructure to develop like deep

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.810 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to develop like deep executed contact tree right and when

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.730 align:start position:0%
executed contact tree right and when that happened we can have several

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.390 align:start position:0%
that happened we can have several hundreds of contracts executed right per

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.770 align:start position:0%
hundreds of contracts executed right per transaction

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.490 align:start position:0%
transaction and I just kind of like a horrified of

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.190 align:start position:0%
and I just kind of like a horrified of the idea that as a result of that we're

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.669 align:start position:0%
the idea that as a result of that we're going to have hundreds of signature in

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:06.909 align:start position:0%
going to have hundreds of signature in each transaction

00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:08.570 align:start position:0%
each transaction account

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.810 align:start position:0%
account so again there is only a single

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.450 align:start position:0%
so again there is only a single signature per account right and said

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.470 align:start position:0%
signature per account right and said like

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.810 align:start position:0%
like the signature flow is you take the

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.289 align:start position:0%
the signature flow is you take the payload which is basically a network

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
payload which is basically a network plus a vector of the invocations you

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.370 align:start position:0%
plus a vector of the invocations you want to or trade you hash it you sign

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.490 align:start position:0%
want to or trade you hash it you sign the hash that's it ah so there is only a

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.610 align:start position:0%
the hash that's it ah so there is only a single signature then the first time

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.930 align:start position:0%
single signature then the first time execution time is the first time the

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.930 align:start position:0%
execution time is the first time the account tries to try something we verify

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.029 align:start position:0%
account tries to try something we verify the signature

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
the signature and then we will just do basically

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
and then we will just do basically matching like weather resist

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.690 align:start position:0%
matching like weather resist invocation is present in the tree or not

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.909 align:start position:0%
invocation is present in the tree or not now

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.029 align:start position:0%
now to the Deep tree topic I don't think

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.830 align:start position:0%
to the Deep tree topic I don't think it's

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
it's it's the new route it has any relevance

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.549 align:start position:0%
it's the new route it has any relevance to this because it's not like it's

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.710 align:start position:0%
to this because it's not like it's impossible to close up to contract now

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.330 align:start position:0%
impossible to close up to contract now and the bank accounts versus these right

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.450 align:start position:0%
and the bank accounts versus these right like you cannot probably execute a

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.250 align:start position:0%
like you cannot probably execute a hundreds of contract calls even if they

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
hundreds of contract calls even if they don't do any actualization shift because

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.450 align:start position:0%
don't do any actualization shift because it will run out of gas before that like

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.090 align:start position:0%
it will run out of gas before that like we are going to have gasoline it on the

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.250 align:start position:0%
we are going to have gasoline it on the transaction so

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
transaction so and I think it's completely

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.630 align:start position:0%
it will always be a better idea to have a single contract than a multiple

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.310 align:start position:0%
a single contract than a multiple contracts than multiple contracts into

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.310 align:start position:0%
contracts than multiple contracts into these things and because cow in a

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
these things and because cow in a contract comes at the cost so

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.770 align:start position:0%
contract comes at the cost so yeah next week very differentiation

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.130 align:start position:0%
yeah next week very differentiation yeah right thank you

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.950 align:start position:0%
yeah right thank you can I give us a question about the to

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.289 align:start position:0%
can I give us a question about the to do with this you know what gets signed

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:51.350 align:start position:0%
do with this you know what gets signed in the subtrees and going back to deem

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.649 align:start position:0%
in the subtrees and going back to deem of a example you provided when you

00:21:54.659 --> 00:21:56.390 align:start position:0%
of a example you provided when you when you're answering one of polls

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.950 align:start position:0%
when you're answering one of polls questions

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.649 align:start position:0%
questions you describe a situation where an

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:01.870 align:start position:0%
you describe a situation where an account

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.370 align:start position:0%
account is signing

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.810 align:start position:0%
is signing like that you're calling a contract

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.909 align:start position:0%
like that you're calling a contract and that contract is calling three other

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:10.669 align:start position:0%
and that contract is calling three other contracts a b and c and this account

00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:13.850 align:start position:0%
contracts a b and c and this account just wants to sign the call to

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.330 align:start position:0%
just wants to sign the call to contract a and the call to contract B

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.490 align:start position:0%
contract a and the call to contract B in that situation is that does that

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.430 align:start position:0%
in that situation is that does that mean that count a science two sub trees

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.770 align:start position:0%
mean that count a science two sub trees like separately so they provide two

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.529 align:start position:0%
like separately so they provide two signatures Play sign a and they sign b

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:30.289 align:start position:0%
signatures Play sign a and they sign b or are they because a few times it's

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:32.090 align:start position:0%
or are they because a few times it's been mentioned that an account only ever

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.250 align:start position:0%
been mentioned that an account only ever provides one signature is there some way

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.830 align:start position:0%
provides one signature is there some way that somehow they sign those two sub

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.130 align:start position:0%
that somehow they sign those two sub trees but it's only one signature or how

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
trees but it's only one signature or how does how does that work yeah so

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.070 align:start position:0%
does how does that work yeah so basically as I said like technically

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.169 align:start position:0%
basically as I said like technically you're not signing the tree you're a

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:50.750 align:start position:0%
you're not signing the tree you're a sign in a forest of treats

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.430 align:start position:0%
sign in a forest of treats so for example if you have a top

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.529 align:start position:0%
so for example if you have a top level router contract that doesn't

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:57.529 align:start position:0%
level router contract that doesn't require any authorization but then you

00:22:57.539 --> 00:22:59.390 align:start position:0%
require any authorization but then you make two subcontract calls that are

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.289 align:start position:0%
make two subcontract calls that are authorized that would spawn to all trees

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:04.610 align:start position:0%
authorized that would spawn to all trees right because they will have different

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.490 align:start position:0%
right because they will have different top level or trades nodes

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start position:0%
top level or trades nodes which I think is fine like you still

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:13.789 align:start position:0%
which I think is fine like you still need just one signature over that as

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:15.289 align:start position:0%
need just one signature over that as I said I'm always saying like one

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:17.810 align:start position:0%
I said I'm always saying like one signature per account account here is

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.409 align:start position:0%
signature per account account here is an account object it doesn't mean

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:23.570 align:start position:0%
an account object it doesn't mean like that it's Unique so if your

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.669 align:start position:0%
like that it's Unique so if your transaction accepts two accounts and

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:27.529 align:start position:0%
transaction accepts two accounts and they happen to be

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.390 align:start position:0%
they happen to be to have the same address very long

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.490 align:start position:0%
to have the same address very long try to duplicate them and then there are

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.130 align:start position:0%
try to duplicate them and then there are a little bit of signatures so you know

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.049 align:start position:0%
a little bit of signatures so you know when I'm talking about like single

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:38.029 align:start position:0%
when I'm talking about like single single short per account that's only in

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:40.370 align:start position:0%
single short per account that's only in the context of that account like in the

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
the context of that account like in the context of the whole transaction there

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.990 align:start position:0%
context of the whole transaction there may be a return number of accounts and

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.049 align:start position:0%
may be a return number of accounts and some of them maybe duplicates and they

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:51.770 align:start position:0%
some of them maybe duplicates and they will have their own signatures too so if

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.529 align:start position:0%
will have their own signatures too so if you don't try to be any more collaborate

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:56.870 align:start position:0%
you don't try to be any more collaborate here so it's yeah one per account not

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.890 align:start position:0%
here so it's yeah one per account not more

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.470 align:start position:0%
more okay so in that in that situation where

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.770 align:start position:0%
okay so in that in that situation where account one wants to sign contract a

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.649 align:start position:0%
account one wants to sign contract a and the contract tree a c but they don't

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:09.049 align:start position:0%
and the contract tree a c but they don't want to sign the top level

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:11.870 align:start position:0%
want to sign the top level like the very very top level contract

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.909 align:start position:0%
like the very very top level contract call they they would provide two

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.950 align:start position:0%
call they they would provide two signatures they would sign like the sub

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
signatures they would sign like the sub tree for contract a the subtree for

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.970 align:start position:0%
tree for contract a the subtree for contract C and then they would include

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.970 align:start position:0%
contract C and then they would include those two signatures

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.730 align:start position:0%
those two signatures is that is that right

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.210 align:start position:0%
is that is that right okay so at first I want to make points

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.710 align:start position:0%
okay so at first I want to make points that I think it's more like it's

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.110 align:start position:0%
that I think it's more like it's important to practice say that it's not

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.570 align:start position:0%
important to practice say that it's not that account wants to do something it's

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.450 align:start position:0%
that account wants to do something it's what the contract wants to do because

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
what the contract wants to do because the source of the signature pullouts in

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.330 align:start position:0%
the source of the signature pullouts in the first place is the contract it's

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.770 align:start position:0%
the first place is the contract it's not the account the count row is to

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.870 align:start position:0%
not the account the count row is to verify the signature like an account

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.810 align:start position:0%
verify the signature like an account contract account in a more broad context

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.570 align:start position:0%
contract account in a more broad context or always to sign stuff eight and seven

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.850 align:start position:0%
or always to sign stuff eight and seven so

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:03.169 align:start position:0%
so basically depending on the call tree you

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
basically depending on the call tree you will get different results for example

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.390 align:start position:0%
will get different results for example if you have a contract

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.270 align:start position:0%
if you have a contract as I said that calls independently into

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.049 align:start position:0%
as I said that calls independently into say contract B and contract c

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:15.710 align:start position:0%
say contract B and contract c

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.430 align:start position:0%
but you provide it once at the top level you'll get a single payload

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.310 align:start position:0%
you'll get a single payload so let's say you have a contract a that

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.850 align:start position:0%
so let's say you have a contract a that doesn't require authorization itself

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.409 align:start position:0%
doesn't require authorization itself but it does go into contracts bncs and

00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:35.810 align:start position:0%
but it does go into contracts bncs and direct prioritization

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.990 align:start position:0%
direct prioritization if you provide contract a then you

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.529 align:start position:0%
if you provide contract a then you will get a single payload with both

00:25:42.539 --> 00:25:47.810 align:start position:0%
will get a single payload with both invocations but on the other hand you

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.610 align:start position:0%
invocations but on the other hand you could

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.610 align:start position:0%
could just pre-sign contract B and contract

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.450 align:start position:0%
just pre-sign contract B and contract C and then write like you don't want

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.190 align:start position:0%
C and then write like you don't want to know the user to know about your top

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.049 align:start position:0%
to know the user to know about your top level contract then your top level

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
level contract then your top level contractual when you take care about

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.110 align:start position:0%
contractual when you take care about having two different accounts right but

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.570 align:start position:0%
having two different accounts right but it will be still possible to forward the

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
it will be still possible to forward the signature so basically it's whatever

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.549 align:start position:0%
signature so basically it's whatever the contracts Define and whatever you

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:16.010 align:start position:0%
the contracts Define and whatever you try to prep white or build signatures

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.769 align:start position:0%
try to prep white or build signatures for it's driven by the contract

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:22.789 align:start position:0%
for it's driven by the contract interfaces so I mean

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:26.090 align:start position:0%
interfaces so I mean it's probably a good idea to try to

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.630 align:start position:0%
it's probably a good idea to try to implement things in a way that

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.970 align:start position:0%
implement things in a way that only a single signature is needed so

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
only a single signature is needed so that you know we have some Atomic

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.590 align:start position:0%
that you know we have some Atomic operation per account that may involve

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.570 align:start position:0%
operation per account that may involve arbitrary number of subcontractables but

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.330 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number of subcontractables but nothing limits you from you know using

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.630 align:start position:0%
nothing limits you from you know using small result present calls but you will

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.269 align:start position:0%
small result present calls but you will need to this needs to be reflected in

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:51.350 align:start position:0%
need to this needs to be reflected in the contract interface and

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
the contract interface and implementation that's right so what

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.070 align:start position:0%
implementation that's right so what you're saying is that

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.850 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that contract a could just sign the entire

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.430 align:start position:0%
contract a could just sign the entire tree if they wanted to

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.289 align:start position:0%
tree if they wanted to yeah like you you would need some

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:04.630 align:start position:0%
yeah like you you would need some criticize

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.390 align:start position:0%
criticize instead of so if you just so just

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.250 align:start position:0%
instead of so if you just so just ignoring PreFlight for a second just

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.370 align:start position:0%
ignoring PreFlight for a second just assuming that the developers here

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.529 align:start position:0%
assuming that the developers here know how to build these trees themselves

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:16.850 align:start position:0%
know how to build these trees themselves they know how to do all the signage

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.289 align:start position:0%
they know how to do all the signage themselves I'm not really too interested

00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:20.930 align:start position:0%
themselves I'm not really too interested in the automation just yet but

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.210 align:start position:0%
in the automation just yet but a developer could choose to sign the

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.010 align:start position:0%
a developer could choose to sign the entire tree and they would be signing a

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.930 align:start position:0%
entire tree and they would be signing a b and c

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.870 align:start position:0%
b and c or they can choose to sign just the

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
or they can choose to sign just the subtree A and Justice subtree C and

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.930 align:start position:0%
subtree A and Justice subtree C and include those two signatures

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.090 align:start position:0%
include those two signatures basically yeah like as one is your

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.789 align:start position:0%
basically yeah like as one is your Forest of trees corresponds to what what

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.649 align:start position:0%
Forest of trees corresponds to what what has been authorized you should be fine

00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:46.190 align:start position:0%
has been authorized you should be fine so you know if but basically what you

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.110 align:start position:0%
so you know if but basically what you can do like if you're in full control of

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.409 align:start position:0%
can do like if you're in full control of all the execution paths you will just

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:54.470 align:start position:0%
all the execution paths you will just look at where your authorization secure

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.049 align:start position:0%
look at where your authorization secure and you would include all this into

00:27:57.059 --> 00:27:59.149 align:start position:0%
and you would include all this into the signature pivot where signing it and

00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:02.210 align:start position:0%
the signature pivot where signing it and then you basically can embed this sub

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.409 align:start position:0%
then you basically can embed this sub trees in arbitrary called trees

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:09.890 align:start position:0%
trees in arbitrary called trees you care about as well for example the

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.029 align:start position:0%
you care about as well for example the same topology

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:14.029 align:start position:0%
same topology and a signature Bionic

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:18.649 align:start position:0%
and a signature Bionic a signature on a tree will just mean

00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:20.810 align:start position:0%
a signature on a tree will just mean that whatever the address is for that

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.630 align:start position:0%
that whatever the address is for that signature is authorized anywhere in that

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.850 align:start position:0%
signature is authorized anywhere in that tree where that address shows up is that

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.310 align:start position:0%
tree where that address shows up is that correct

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
correct authorized anywhere the contract

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.990 align:start position:0%
authorized anywhere the contract calls all tries on it right so there is

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.669 align:start position:0%
calls all tries on it right so there is anywhere contract requested

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:43.310 align:start position:0%
anywhere contract requested authorization

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.230 align:start position:0%
I have a question related to this about authorization context and the call stack

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.690 align:start position:0%
authorization context and the call stack so if you if you invoke a contract a

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.190 align:start position:0%
so if you if you invoke a contract a that calls B and you know B is the only

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
that calls B and you know B is the only one that calls authorized then a is not

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.789 align:start position:0%
one that calls authorized then a is not part of the context how long someone to

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:57.710 align:start position:0%
part of the context how long someone to front run a by submitting B

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.330 align:start position:0%
front run a by submitting B I'm wondering if there are any security

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.130 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there are any security issues or weird use cases here and if we

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.990 align:start position:0%
issues or weird use cases here and if we should consider requiring the full call

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.149 align:start position:0%
should consider requiring the full call stack by default with the option to

00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:06.830 align:start position:0%
stack by default with the option to authorize the subset the cost stack and

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.049 align:start position:0%
authorize the subset the cost stack and then the concern here is a high level if

00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:10.430 align:start position:0%
then the concern here is a high level if it's possible for the front run to

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.890 align:start position:0%
it's possible for the front run to prevent I expected logic from running

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.909 align:start position:0%
prevent I expected logic from running well it sounds right like at first

00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:18.830 align:start position:0%
well it sounds right like at first that was a consideration to include like

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.049 align:start position:0%
that was a consideration to include like the full cost tax but the scenarios like

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.909 align:start position:0%
the full cost tax but the scenarios like we have just discussed such scenarios

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:27.230 align:start position:0%
we have just discussed such scenarios like it's rather limited and makes use

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.470 align:start position:0%
like it's rather limited and makes use cases like exchanges much trigger to

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.529 align:start position:0%
cases like exchanges much trigger to implement properly because you know you

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:35.810 align:start position:0%
implement properly because you know you may care only about like swapping the

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.570 align:start position:0%
may care only about like swapping the token and you don't want to care about

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.230 align:start position:0%
token and you don't want to care about like how exactly it has been solved

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.230 align:start position:0%
like how exactly it has been solved and and so from training some

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.450 align:start position:0%
and and so from training some contracts would indeed need some

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.630 align:start position:0%
contracts would indeed need some front-end prevention in place so for

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.389 align:start position:0%
front-end prevention in place so for example you know coming back to the

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:55.789 align:start position:0%
example you know coming back to the batching the operations example right so

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:58.190 align:start position:0%
batching the operations example right so let's say your contract clears multiple

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.090 align:start position:0%
let's say your contract clears multiple swaps and swap May Fail for multiple

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
swaps and swap May Fail for multiple reasons one of them is run signatures

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.930 align:start position:0%
reasons one of them is run signatures another one is front run right someone

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.049 align:start position:0%
another one is front run right someone front Trends is Swap and it's no longer

00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:10.850 align:start position:0%
front Trends is Swap and it's no longer valid right

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.669 align:start position:0%
valid right this case is really not different

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
this case is really not different from any other failure like just write

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.889 align:start position:0%
from any other failure like just write contract in a way that it gracefully

00:30:18.899 --> 00:30:20.870 align:start position:0%
contract in a way that it gracefully handles the failures and you should be

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.610 align:start position:0%
handles the failures and you should be good

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.970 align:start position:0%
good as for security issues I mean

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.730 align:start position:0%
as for security issues I mean it is possible to write a contract in

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.529 align:start position:0%
it is possible to write a contract in such a way that you can transfer into

00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:34.010 align:start position:0%
such a way that you can transfer into signature for it and it's one to the

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.010 align:start position:0%
signature for it and it's one to the right thing but it's probably on the

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.110 align:start position:0%
right thing but it's probably on the contract and so I can implementation

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.430 align:start position:0%
contract and so I can implementation issue right

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.310 align:start position:0%
issue right normally what you should require is

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.169 align:start position:0%
normally what you should require is easier to sign should be it should be a

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:47.810 align:start position:0%
easier to sign should be it should be a some sort of atomic operation that the

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.730 align:start position:0%
some sort of atomic operation that the user should intend to perform it

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
user should intend to perform it shouldn't be some middle step so for

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.169 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be some middle step so for example

00:30:53.179 --> 00:30:57.289 align:start position:0%
example if I want to create a clinical balance

00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
if I want to create a clinical balance for example a simple thing right I

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.149 align:start position:0%
for example a simple thing right I want to transfer the token to the

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
want to transfer the token to the contract and I want to create an entry

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
contract and I want to create an entry on behalf of this user

00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:10.730 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this user I could drive this incorrectly and

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.190 align:start position:0%
I could drive this incorrectly and take just the signature for a transfer

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.810 align:start position:0%
take just the signature for a transfer and you can

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.669 align:start position:0%
and you can from transit signature quarter transfer

00:31:16.679 --> 00:31:18.950 align:start position:0%
from transit signature quarter transfer but that's obviously about what I should

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
but that's obviously about what I should do is I should reverse the authorization

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.909 align:start position:0%
do is I should reverse the authorization the whole thing I'll use the pro or

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:25.029 align:start position:0%
the whole thing I'll use the pro or whatever so I mean

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:27.769 align:start position:0%
whatever so I mean bugs would exist for any sort of

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
bugs would exist for any sort of authorizations but

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.769 align:start position:0%
authorizations but I don't really see an inherent security

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
I don't really see an inherent security risk here and so on as you don't require

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.610 align:start position:0%
risk here and so on as you don't require the user to sign some non-atomic

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.490 align:start position:0%
the user to sign some non-atomic things that you will build storage

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.049 align:start position:0%
things that you will build storage account

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:47.029 align:start position:0%
account so let's say coming back to the swap

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
so let's say coming back to the swap example let's say you did something

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:52.549 align:start position:0%
example let's say you did something based on the swap outcome then probably

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:55.130 align:start position:0%
based on the swap outcome then probably you would want to or trades your top

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.169 align:start position:0%
you would want to or trades your top level contract that does the swaps

00:31:57.179 --> 00:31:59.450 align:start position:0%
level contract that does the swaps because it does something else will

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.730 align:start position:0%
because it does something else will probably need to be or trade right and

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.610 align:start position:0%
probably need to be or trade right and you don't want it to be functional

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.870 align:start position:0%
you don't want it to be functional

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.190 align:start position:0%
right so and also there's a front training prevention topic

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.090 align:start position:0%
training prevention topic

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.970 align:start position:0%
never mind okay go ahead yeah so like the you said it makes sense like the the

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.649 align:start position:0%
the you said it makes sense like the the one thing I'm concerned about is you

00:32:18.659 --> 00:32:20.630 align:start position:0%
one thing I'm concerned about is you know the the authorization authorization

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.909 align:start position:0%
know the the authorization authorization context is determined by the contracts

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:25.310 align:start position:0%
context is determined by the contracts right as you mentioned and the user

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.149 align:start position:0%
right as you mentioned and the user is just going to sign whatever

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:28.850 align:start position:0%
is just going to sign whatever pre-flight returns so and these bugs are

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.649 align:start position:0%
pre-flight returns so and these bugs are not that like you know if you don't have

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:32.269 align:start position:0%
not that like you know if you don't have a great understanding of how

00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:34.370 align:start position:0%
a great understanding of how this authorization that these

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.169 align:start position:0%
this authorization that these authorization Mechanics Work you may not

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.850 align:start position:0%
authorization Mechanics Work you may not see it when you look at the contract and

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
see it when you look at the contract and the user is just going to sign whatever

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.330 align:start position:0%
the user is just going to sign whatever pre-file returns so it may not be you

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.889 align:start position:0%
pre-file returns so it may not be you know at any point easy to see what the

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
know at any point easy to see what the issue is until until it's too late

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.029 align:start position:0%
issue is until until it's too late so that's just my concern I don't

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
so that's just my concern I don't know if no I'm still not sure if this

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.769 align:start position:0%
know if no I'm still not sure if this is so go ahead yeah yeah I know my

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:53.690 align:start position:0%
is so go ahead yeah yeah I know my intuition is that again this is probably

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.810 align:start position:0%
intuition is that again this is probably the case for any sort of traditions like

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.210 align:start position:0%
the case for any sort of traditions like let's say you understand the whole tree

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.090 align:start position:0%
let's say you understand the whole tree like do you really think that add in

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.190 align:start position:0%
like do you really think that add in like a bunch of stuff does a tree would

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.750 align:start position:0%
like a bunch of stuff does a tree would like prevent some weird cases when

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.789 align:start position:0%
like prevent some weird cases when you sign something that you didn't think

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:13.250 align:start position:0%
you sign something that you didn't think yeah I'm not sure

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.009 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure but I think a great thing that

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:19.009 align:start position:0%
but I think a great thing that structural payloads are always it's

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:21.409 align:start position:0%
structural payloads are always it's it should be easy to implement a generic

00:33:21.419 --> 00:33:25.490 align:start position:0%
it should be easy to implement a generic forward support for just parsing this

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.789 align:start position:0%
forward support for just parsing this tree and finding the relevant code you

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
tree and finding the relevant code you know like if you send something to The

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
know like if you send something to The Exchange that it's supposed to sell

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.889 align:start position:0%
Exchange that it's supposed to sell token a for you and you get your payload

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:38.570 align:start position:0%
token a for you and you get your payload and your vote says hey this is going to

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.090 align:start position:0%
and your vote says hey this is going to withdraw like 10x of the token a that

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.669 align:start position:0%
withdraw like 10x of the token a that you actually wanted to trade then you

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.529 align:start position:0%
you actually wanted to trade then you know you probably won't find this and

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:47.750 align:start position:0%
know you probably won't find this and wait you wouldn't worry about this too

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.009 align:start position:0%
wait you wouldn't worry about this too much

00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:50.029 align:start position:0%
much

00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:55.130 align:start position:0%
so yeah there is definitely like more control from the interesting point

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.210 align:start position:0%
control from the interesting point in a generic scenario I agree that

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.789 align:start position:0%
in a generic scenario I agree that some things might be vulnerable and

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:04.549 align:start position:0%
some things might be vulnerable and these are wouldn't know about that but

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:08.329 align:start position:0%
these are wouldn't know about that but I'm yeah I I don't have a good

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:10.430 align:start position:0%
I'm yeah I I don't have a good understanding of how prevalent would

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.430 align:start position:0%
understanding of how prevalent would this be or how dangerous would this be

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.629 align:start position:0%
this be or how dangerous would this be because well

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
because well and so it could be

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.250 align:start position:0%
and so it could be contracted a flowed in multiple wage

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.530 align:start position:0%
contracted a flowed in multiple wage rate and you wouldn't know so it's I

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
rate and you wouldn't know so it's I guess the question of trust and you

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.909 align:start position:0%
guess the question of trust and you know only using the things that matter

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
know only using the things that matter and the fact that we at least can easily

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.430 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we at least can easily know what the contract trying to go to

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.470 align:start position:0%
know what the contract trying to go to your tokens or whatever other

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.570 align:start position:0%
your tokens or whatever other Commodities you have

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.570 align:start position:0%
Commodities you have it's already a big wins here

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.030 align:start position:0%
it's already a big wins here because like kind of limits the

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.210 align:start position:0%
because like kind of limits the impact simulator

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:54.109 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thanks Dina

00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:57.470 align:start position:0%
any further questions

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.990 align:start position:0%
Lee yeah I have a question but it's it's a little bit derailing so

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.950 align:start position:0%
a little bit derailing so

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:08.030 align:start position:0%
I feel like I want to if anyone else has questions that are moral on the line of

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.290 align:start position:0%
questions that are moral on the line of what we're already talking about that

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:16.490 align:start position:0%
what we're already talking about that might be best to do first

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.750 align:start position:0%
the URL awaitly

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:26.510 align:start position:0%
so I'm interested in Anna have a proposal interacts with the simple

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.970 align:start position:0%
proposal interacts with the simple invoker auth case that we we currently

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.290 align:start position:0%
invoker auth case that we we currently support today so

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
support today so I think when timer was describing

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.069 align:start position:0%
I think when timer was describing before you know we developed the current

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
before you know we developed the current version of sorbenorth we realized that

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.230 align:start position:0%
version of sorbenorth we realized that it's actually relatively

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.210 align:start position:0%
it's actually relatively complicated to use and so then we

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.849 align:start position:0%
complicated to use and so then we went and had added invoker auth which is

00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:47.750 align:start position:0%
went and had added invoker auth which is basically the same as message.sender in

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.130 align:start position:0%
basically the same as message.sender in the ethereum world

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.470 align:start position:0%
the ethereum world and the way that it's implemented is the

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.530 align:start position:0%
and the way that it's implemented is the source account on the operation is the

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
source account on the operation is the invoker and so a contract can just say

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.450 align:start position:0%
invoker and so a contract can just say who's the invoker and they'll either get

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
who's the invoker and they'll either get back and address they'll get back an

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.170 align:start position:0%
back and address they'll get back an address which is either the source

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.870 align:start position:0%
address which is either the source account on the operation or the contract

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.569 align:start position:0%
account on the operation or the contract that's calling them

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:11.089 align:start position:0%
that's calling them

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.210 align:start position:0%
yeah I saw I I understand that the proposal basically says okay there's the

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.270 align:start position:0%
proposal basically says okay there's the proposal replaces the complicated and

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.950 align:start position:0%
proposal replaces the complicated and the simple auth we have today and

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.710 align:start position:0%
the simple auth we have today and creates a single unified interface that

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.109 align:start position:0%
creates a single unified interface that contracts use to

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:32.210 align:start position:0%
contracts use to verify that the address is authorized

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.250 align:start position:0%
verify that the address is authorized I'm just wondering like if there's a

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.849 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering like if there's a way that we can retain the simplicity so

00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:41.750 align:start position:0%
way that we can retain the simplicity so that for the vast majority of contracts

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.270 align:start position:0%
that for the vast majority of contracts enter the wallets and contract

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
enter the wallets and contract interactions they still have the

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.370 align:start position:0%
interactions they still have the simplest form of in terms of like what

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.250 align:start position:0%
simplest form of in terms of like what they need to sign it's like the simplest

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.329 align:start position:0%
they need to sign it's like the simplest

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.550 align:start position:0%
without needing to go and sign these call statues

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.710 align:start position:0%
well I mean the host Tech tree for the case

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.609 align:start position:0%
I mean the host Tech tree for the case that is currently an invoker case it's

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:09.650 align:start position:0%
that is currently an invoker case it's pretty much equivalent to just the

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.810 align:start position:0%
pretty much equivalent to just the conflicting location right because it

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.170 align:start position:0%
conflicting location right because it consists only of a single invocation and

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.650 align:start position:0%
consists only of a single invocation and you know you just add a vector around

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.250 align:start position:0%
you know you just add a vector around the things that already exists

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.569 align:start position:0%
the things that already exists so even if that call has like so

00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:29.150 align:start position:0%
so even if that call has like so I'm calling just one contract but that

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.010 align:start position:0%
I'm calling just one contract but that contract may be calling five other

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.050 align:start position:0%
contract may be calling five other contracts as a part of its

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
contracts as a part of its what it's going to go do

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.069 align:start position:0%
what it's going to go do those calls may be unimportant to me

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:39.470 align:start position:0%
those calls may be unimportant to me so maybe they're just calling out to an

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.829 align:start position:0%
so maybe they're just calling out to an oracle again some information

00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:46.069 align:start position:0%
oracle again some information again Nano Trace calls are not

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:48.770 align:start position:0%
again Nano Trace calls are not included in the payload wait this is an

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.690 align:start position:0%
included in the payload wait this is an important point I want to reiterate

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.650 align:start position:0%
important point I want to reiterate again

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.589 align:start position:0%
again that what what these are Sciences only

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:59.150 align:start position:0%
that what what these are Sciences only the authorized upset of the whole

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.349 align:start position:0%
the authorized upset of the whole country

00:38:00.359 --> 00:38:04.490 align:start position:0%
country so it doesn't include any in between or

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.010 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't include any in between or side calls

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
side calls even if the authorized call is the top

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
even if the authorized call is the top layer so even if I'm

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.150 align:start position:0%
layer so even if I'm like the top call is going to be

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.690 align:start position:0%
like the top call is going to be authorized

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.490 align:start position:0%
Ultra is doesn't propagate anywhere authorize means that I'll try this and

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.010 align:start position:0%
authorize means that I'll try this and only this added in the current context

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.290 align:start position:0%
only this added in the current context that's it it doesn't say anything about

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.010 align:start position:0%
that's it it doesn't say anything about inside invocation so that curse would

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.589 align:start position:0%
inside invocation so that curse would not contain things that are not done on

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:34.790 align:start position:0%
not contain things that are not done on your behalf

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.170 align:start position:0%
your behalf so whatever the contract calls into

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.329 align:start position:0%
so whatever the contract calls into doesn't matter for the secret signature

00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:43.970 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter for the secret signature so for the case where invoker is used

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.010 align:start position:0%
so for the case where invoker is used currently I mean invoker cannot be

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.290 align:start position:0%
currently I mean invoker cannot be propagated currently right you cannot

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.089 align:start position:0%
propagated currently right you cannot forward the invoker to the other

00:38:50.099 --> 00:38:52.550 align:start position:0%
forward the invoker to the other contract which actually they have seen

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
contract which actually they have seen from discussion it's kind of a bit

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.829 align:start position:0%
from discussion it's kind of a bit annoying and confusing right because you

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:00.069 align:start position:0%
annoying and confusing right because you may sometimes want to propagate it

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:03.109 align:start position:0%
may sometimes want to propagate it but yeah this is a side like in this

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:05.150 align:start position:0%
but yeah this is a side like in this exact use case when you don't propagate

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
exact use case when you don't propagate the top level account anywhere the

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.750 align:start position:0%
the top level account anywhere the signature pillow it will be almost

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.930 align:start position:0%
signature pillow it will be almost exactly the same module of the different

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.089 align:start position:0%
exactly the same module of the different structure rate instead of like having a

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:17.210 align:start position:0%
structure rate instead of like having a single contract and invocation you will

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.050 align:start position:0%
single contract and invocation you will handle it support into a vector and

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.130 align:start position:0%
handle it support into a vector and that's pretty much it and you will have

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.109 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much it and you will have a signature a few different plates so

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:27.890 align:start position:0%
a signature a few different plates so you know from adapt perspective it

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.710 align:start position:0%
you know from adapt perspective it will be marginally harder to build this

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.990 align:start position:0%
will be marginally harder to build this payload but you know doesn't need to

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.290 align:start position:0%
payload but you know doesn't need to account for anything new so just need to

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.530 align:start position:0%
account for anything new so just need to use a bit different structures and

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.050 align:start position:0%
use a bit different structures and from the transaction State Savings

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.310 align:start position:0%
from the transaction State Savings endpoint like we are keeping the

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.589 align:start position:0%
endpoint like we are keeping the invoker making sure to like save on

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:50.990 align:start position:0%
invoker making sure to like save on signatures and you know if the source

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.150 align:start position:0%
signatures and you know if the source account thanks a whole transaction and

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.329 align:start position:0%
account thanks a whole transaction and the contract call it is possible to

00:39:56.339 --> 00:40:00.290 align:start position:0%
the contract call it is possible to mark that it is an invoker and do not

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.450 align:start position:0%
mark that it is an invoker and do not require like a second signature

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.410 align:start position:0%
require like a second signature so

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.770 align:start position:0%
so the optimization part is there two and

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.030 align:start position:0%
the optimization part is there two and

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.410 align:start position:0%
yeah the only thing that kind of changes from the contract interface 10 point is

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.690 align:start position:0%
from the contract interface 10 point is that yeah you need to pass the account

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.230 align:start position:0%
that yeah you need to pass the account explicitly and intercourageon account we

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
explicitly and intercourageon account we may or may not introduce some sugar in

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.650 align:start position:0%
may or may not introduce some sugar in SDK to simplify that and make it so you

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:27.109 align:start position:0%
SDK to simplify that and make it so you don't really need to type what you want

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:30.530 align:start position:0%
don't really need to type what you want to authorize but you know it's like one

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
to authorize but you know it's like one line of code

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.849 align:start position:0%
line of code we also want to do this for the sake

00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:37.609 align:start position:0%
we also want to do this for the sake of Click so if you can but

00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:40.849 align:start position:0%
of Click so if you can but I don't think it's too big of a

00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:45.829 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's too big of a an issue to basically do this but on the

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:49.250 align:start position:0%
an issue to basically do this but on the other hand like it is now possible to

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.770 align:start position:0%
other hand like it is now possible to for the constant to do things on behalf

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.170 align:start position:0%
for the constant to do things on behalf of accounts in the sub course which is

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.569 align:start position:0%
of accounts in the sub course which is not possible within local current which

00:40:56.579 --> 00:41:03.650 align:start position:0%
not possible within local current which I think is yeah yeah of course

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.290 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think an optimization like if if there is some way for us to

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.050 align:start position:0%
like if if there is some way for us to retain an optimization where The Source

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.510 align:start position:0%
retain an optimization where The Source The Source account could still be used

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.370 align:start position:0%
The Source account could still be used to authorize

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.290 align:start position:0%
to authorize I I guess the because I'm not really

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.849 align:start position:0%
I I guess the because I'm not really too concerned about that one line of

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
too concerned about that one line of code that a contract has to add

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.730 align:start position:0%
code that a contract has to add I'm more concerned about what that

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.490 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned about what that the story is for a Dap or a wallet

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.109 align:start position:0%
the story is for a Dap or a wallet developer

00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:31.970 align:start position:0%
developer

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.050 align:start position:0%
yeah but the transaction you know a number of things I need to sign like

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.730 align:start position:0%
number of things I need to sign like like a you know like a hardware wallet

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.470 align:start position:0%
like a you know like a hardware wallet needing to sign the Stellar transaction

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.470 align:start position:0%
needing to sign the Stellar transaction as well as this blob which is like two

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.089 align:start position:0%
as well as this blob which is like two signatures

00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:46.310 align:start position:0%
signatures so two rounds of signing they need to

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.490 align:start position:0%
so two rounds of signing they need to go through versus if the if 99 of

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.349 align:start position:0%
go through versus if the if 99 of contract calls really only just need

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:53.150 align:start position:0%
contract calls really only just need that Source account you know they really

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.410 align:start position:0%
that Source account you know they really only then have to sign just the

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.630 align:start position:0%
only then have to sign just the transaction once which is

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.569 align:start position:0%
transaction once which is yeah yeah I think you definitely want to

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:02.569 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think you definitely want to preserve that it's increase that for

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:04.970 align:start position:0%
preserve that it's increase that for the signature key test when you know

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.010 align:start position:0%
the signature key test when you know you'll pay for the transaction that your

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.690 align:start position:0%
you'll pay for the transaction that your qualities or one contract it's

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.650 align:start position:0%
qualities or one contract it's definitely easier to

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.930 align:start position:0%
definitely easier to just passing a signal curvy so

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
just passing a signal curvy so basically yeah it doesn't go anywhere

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.910 align:start position:0%
basically yeah it doesn't go anywhere but it will be possible to do

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.670 align:start position:0%
but it will be possible to do everything in this single signature

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.410 align:start position:0%
everything in this single signature how frequently this will be used

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.390 align:start position:0%
how frequently this will be used compared to something else we don't know

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.430 align:start position:0%
compared to something else we don't know yet because we have discussed a lot of

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.890 align:start position:0%
yet because we have discussed a lot of the cases and you know some third-party

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.170 align:start position:0%
the cases and you know some third-party page for the fees but you know that's

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.510 align:start position:0%
page for the fees but you know that's something you've got a secret you know

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.730 align:start position:0%
something you've got a secret you know it's a case for the user to just send a

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.430 align:start position:0%
it's a case for the user to just send a transaction to Samsung do to your

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
transaction to Samsung do to your business and this multi-help

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.810 align:start position:0%
business and this multi-help transactions hopefully possible to sign

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:49.310 align:start position:0%
transactions hopefully possible to sign other corporations at once while still

00:42:49.320 --> 00:43:06.170 align:start position:0%
other corporations at once while still being compatible with something

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:12.950 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions either from anyone on the stage or the audience

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.829 align:start position:0%
I have a minor question that maybe like you can you can explain like in the

00:43:18.839 --> 00:43:20.930 align:start position:0%
you can you can explain like in the Prototype why is authorize called

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.010 align:start position:0%
Prototype why is authorize called authorized instead of something like

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.510 align:start position:0%
authorized instead of something like verify authorization

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.130 align:start position:0%
verify authorization I think that was done intentionally but

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.710 align:start position:0%
I think that was done intentionally but I don't recall the reason

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.809 align:start position:0%
I don't recall the reason I no I I don't think there is reasons

00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:34.069 align:start position:0%
I no I I don't think there is reasons okay

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.670 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean odd trays it's like

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.750 align:start position:0%
odd trays it's like I don't know

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.970 align:start position:0%
I'll try this current invocation but if it's confusing you can use whatever name

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.930 align:start position:0%
it's confusing you can use whatever name defines you to go

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.670 align:start position:0%
defines you to go to college verify that's radiation as

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:59.870 align:start position:0%
to college verify that's radiation as well check I don't know

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:11.210 align:start position:0%
foreign

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.990 align:start position:0%
okay so I think there's

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.930 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the the last one we touched on which is having to sign multiple

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.950 align:start position:0%
on which is having to sign multiple payloads for the even for a simple

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.210 align:start position:0%
payloads for the even for a simple case

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.130 align:start position:0%
case I think that's a no-go I think we

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.470 align:start position:0%
I think that's a no-go I think we need to either optimize for that

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.170 align:start position:0%
need to either optimize for that or or scrap this at the end of the

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.329 align:start position:0%
or or scrap this at the end of the day people are using external signing

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:36.829 align:start position:0%
day people are using external signing applications people are using Hardware

00:44:36.839 --> 00:44:38.870 align:start position:0%
applications people are using Hardware wallets

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.670 align:start position:0%
wallets and we need to figure out for the

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.069 align:start position:0%
and we need to figure out for the simple use case how to sign a single

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:45.050 align:start position:0%
simple use case how to sign a single payload

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.849 align:start position:0%
payload

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.890 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so let's stay so I'm yeah I'm not saying this is going to go anywhere

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.910 align:start position:0%
not saying this is going to go anywhere so

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.370 align:start position:0%
so as simple use cases will be possible but

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.250 align:start position:0%
as simple use cases will be possible but you know for the complex use cases you

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.890 align:start position:0%
you know for the complex use cases you may end up needing to send two things

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.930 align:start position:0%
may end up needing to send two things but yeah

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:10.329 align:start position:0%
do you mean the simple use case would be satisfied by just keeping the existing

00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:12.530 align:start position:0%
satisfied by just keeping the existing invokerol with capability or are you

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.030 align:start position:0%
invokerol with capability or are you meaning that we would introduce an

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.309 align:start position:0%
meaning that we would introduce an optimization into this proposal so that

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:18.770 align:start position:0%
optimization into this proposal so that the contract still uses the same method

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.569 align:start position:0%
the contract still uses the same method they still call Dot authorize or dot

00:45:20.579 --> 00:45:22.309 align:start position:0%
they still call Dot authorize or dot verify authorization yeah nothing

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.890 align:start position:0%
verify authorization yeah nothing changes somehow comes from the The

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.410 align:start position:0%
changes somehow comes from the The Source account Yeah so basically we

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.990 align:start position:0%
Source account Yeah so basically we don't truly awake

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.569 align:start position:0%
don't truly awake the whole driver for this proposal

00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:34.910 align:start position:0%
the whole driver for this proposal was to kind of have unified account

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.089 align:start position:0%
was to kind of have unified account oh sorry unified Contracting rupees and

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:40.250 align:start position:0%
oh sorry unified Contracting rupees and you know I find it kind of

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.690 align:start position:0%
you know I find it kind of problematic that

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.849 align:start position:0%
problematic that you kind of hard code your contract to

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
you kind of hard code your contract to use invoker right if you don't use

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.230 align:start position:0%
use invoker right if you don't use Advanced host on the current approach

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.050 align:start position:0%
Advanced host on the current approach and that's kind of bad right because if

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.210 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of bad right because if you want to use this in a different

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
you want to use this in a different context you cannot it's hard cut a teas

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.109 align:start position:0%
context you cannot it's hard cut a teas and Walker

00:45:57.119 --> 00:46:00.170 align:start position:0%
and Walker so the contract interface itself uses

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.089 align:start position:0%
so the contract interface itself uses what's next it uses accounts and

00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:05.150 align:start position:0%
what's next it uses accounts and addresses and the abstraction and you

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.309 align:start position:0%
addresses and the abstraction and you know one of the implementations of that

00:46:07.319 --> 00:46:10.190 align:start position:0%
know one of the implementations of that abstract account even though it's kind

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
abstract account even though it's kind of built into host but it's just

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.450 align:start position:0%
of built into host but it's just invokers rate it's just one of

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.829 align:start position:0%
invokers rate it's just one of implementation of the abstract account

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.930 align:start position:0%
implementation of the abstract account contracts shouldn't worry about that

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.790 align:start position:0%
contracts shouldn't worry about that it's all implemented in the host and

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.609 align:start position:0%
it's all implemented in the host and it's in the current prototype as well

00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:24.370 align:start position:0%
it's in the current prototype as well so yeah

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.829 align:start position:0%
so yeah let's Chooser and by simple use case I

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:31.010 align:start position:0%
let's Chooser and by simple use case I mean the cases when there is only single

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.670 align:start position:0%
mean the cases when there is only single accounts it needs to trace operations

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
accounts it needs to trace operations you know throughout multiple accounts

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.470 align:start position:0%
you know throughout multiple accounts and one of them can actually can be

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.230 align:start position:0%
and one of them can actually can be invoker but that's reason to pre-size

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.450 align:start position:0%
invoker but that's reason to pre-size something but they want me to sign the

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.609 align:start position:0%
something but they want me to sign the storage induction so hopefully you know

00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:48.829 align:start position:0%
storage induction so hopefully you know a majority of the case is only single

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:51.230 align:start position:0%
a majority of the case is only single signatures needed

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.390 align:start position:0%
signatures needed so just to be on the same this is

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.050 align:start position:0%
so just to be on the same this is implemented in your host prototype for

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.230 align:start position:0%
implemented in your host prototype for off next right now yeah it's in the Pro

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
off next right now yeah it's in the Pro Tab right now

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.450 align:start position:0%
Tab right now so this is an important thing and it's

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
so this is an important thing and it's important

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:16.730 align:start position:0%
and is the way that that works that you it's only the top level contracts

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.069 align:start position:0%
you it's only the top level contracts but if they call Dot authorize they

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
but if they call Dot authorize they would see the source account as being

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.370 align:start position:0%
would see the source account as being authorized

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.630 align:start position:0%
authorized

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.190 align:start position:0%
yeah they actually will see wait basically the trees teeth sharing the

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.650 align:start position:0%
basically the trees teeth sharing the transaction payload but instead of

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.750 align:start position:0%
transaction payload but instead of cutting the signature you pass nothing

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.089 align:start position:0%
cutting the signature you pass nothing and instead of passing the account ID

00:47:35.099 --> 00:47:36.650 align:start position:0%
and instead of passing the account ID you pass the flag because it's an

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.990 align:start position:0%
you pass the flag because it's an invoker it's similar to how we handle

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
invoker it's similar to how we handle invoker currently in advanced cars it's

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.930 align:start position:0%
invoker currently in advanced cars it's just move to the transaction structure

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.069 align:start position:0%
just move to the transaction structure itself

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:48.050 align:start position:0%
itself right I'm just wondering because in

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.170 align:start position:0%
right I'm just wondering because in Vegas today is only it has no depth

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.770 align:start position:0%
Vegas today is only it has no depth like yeah now it has depth yeah now it

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.809 align:start position:0%
like yeah now it has depth yeah now it will have depth because the transaction

00:47:56.819 --> 00:47:59.630 align:start position:0%
will have depth because the transaction has the whole tree of the coast so

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.010 align:start position:0%
has the whole tree of the coast so basically you are signing the tree

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.010 align:start position:0%
basically you are signing the tree itself which is why it is safe okay so

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.470 align:start position:0%
itself which is why it is safe okay so so this the way the way it's currently

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.809 align:start position:0%
so this the way the way it's currently implemented it's not really messaged us

00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.230 align:start position:0%
implemented it's not really messaged us and it's like the

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.309 align:start position:0%
and it's like the transaction.origin from ethereum it

00:48:13.319 --> 00:48:15.130 align:start position:0%
transaction.origin from ethereum it sounds like is the way that it's working

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.250 align:start position:0%
sounds like is the way that it's working I I'm not sure but I think the key

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.790 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure but I think the key factor here is that you explicitly you

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.710 align:start position:0%
factor here is that you explicitly you still explicitly out price calls right

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.390 align:start position:0%
still explicitly out price calls right it's not like you just gave for a

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.250 align:start position:0%
it's not like you just gave for a contract blanket permissions to call

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.730 align:start position:0%
contract blanket permissions to call things on your behalf it is really

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.490 align:start position:0%
things on your behalf it is really just it's keeping the signature

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.309 align:start position:0%
just it's keeping the signature verification part because you when

00:48:40.319 --> 00:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
verification part because you when you're assigning the transaction or

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.089 align:start position:0%
you're assigning the transaction or operation you are also assigning the

00:48:44.099 --> 00:48:47.890 align:start position:0%
operation you are also assigning the whole authorized call stack payload

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.290 align:start position:0%
whole authorized call stack payload that you've been talking about before

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:55.490 align:start position:0%
that you've been talking about before so yeah so basically yes the world would

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.890 align:start position:0%
so yeah so basically yes the world would need to show you that hey as a part of

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.230 align:start position:0%
need to show you that hey as a part of this operation you

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.829 align:start position:0%
this operation you maybe a sign in multiple token

00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:06.710 align:start position:0%
maybe a sign in multiple token operations for example right but you

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.650 align:start position:0%
operations for example right but you know from the signature standpoint it

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:17.809 align:start position:0%
know from the signature standpoint it needs to still be sanctioned once

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.630 align:start position:0%
so it's basically like msg.center but better because like energy the center is

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.790 align:start position:0%
better because like energy the center is like contingent on the fact that you

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.170 align:start position:0%
like contingent on the fact that you have signed the top level and location

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.410 align:start position:0%
have signed the top level and location here you sign all the invocations

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.690 align:start position:0%
here you sign all the invocations that you need to try

00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:39.950 align:start position:0%
yep okay yeah I'm the reason I just mentioned that the transaction of origin

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.089 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the transaction of origin is because I'm just trying to think of

00:49:41.099 --> 00:49:43.790 align:start position:0%
is because I'm just trying to think of if there's

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.290 align:start position:0%
if there's anything that we really need to worry

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.930 align:start position:0%
anything that we really need to worry because it feels a little bit more like

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.370 align:start position:0%
because it feels a little bit more like transaction.origin in the you know you

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:53.089 align:start position:0%
transaction.origin in the you know you could you're the source account you call

00:49:53.099 --> 00:49:54.710 align:start position:0%
could you're the source account you call this contract either calls another

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.290 align:start position:0%
this contract either calls another contract you tell that other contract

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.030 align:start position:0%
contract you tell that other contract that you're authorizing as the invoker

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
that you're authorizing as the invoker so that other contract is authorized

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.670 align:start position:0%
so that other contract is authorized with the top level Source account

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.569 align:start position:0%
with the top level Source account

00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think yeah I think I think it's probably fine because you're

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.569 align:start position:0%
think it's probably fine because you're right it's reflected in you still have

00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:18.430 align:start position:0%
right it's reflected in you still have to specify yeah yeah

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.790 align:start position:0%
right there is really no way no matter what kind of authorization you use and

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.550 align:start position:0%
what kind of authorization you use and so it's no way to somehow hide the

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.290 align:start position:0%
so it's no way to somehow hide the subcontract call that prefers

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.390 align:start position:0%
subcontract call that prefers authorization so there is really no way

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
authorization so there is really no way to hide some token withdrawals number

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.130 align:start position:0%
to hide some token withdrawals number deep in the trade those still circuits

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.050 align:start position:0%
deep in the trade those still circuits no matter what or it will just fail

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.329 align:start position:0%
no matter what or it will just fail because you haven't seen it

00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:49.010 align:start position:0%
because you haven't seen it yeah

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:57.109 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the stage of the audience

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.370 align:start position:0%
okay so I think you know dima's done a great job at answering all these

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:04.130 align:start position:0%
a great job at answering all these questions I think there's a still

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.870 align:start position:0%
questions I think there's a still most of the concerns are around the

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.309 align:start position:0%
most of the concerns are around the you know what is the contract for the

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
you know what is the contract for the Gap developer and to get insights into

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.250 align:start position:0%
Gap developer and to get insights into that I think we need to regroup and

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.530 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to regroup and probably come up with some you know

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
probably come up with some you know minimal prototypes that help us

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.549 align:start position:0%
minimal prototypes that help us understand that so hopefully that's

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.890 align:start position:0%
understand that so hopefully that's something that we can put together

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.349 align:start position:0%
something that we can put together soon enough and

00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:29.450 align:start position:0%
soon enough and discuss again

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.309 align:start position:0%
discuss again and if

00:51:31.319 --> 00:51:33.710 align:start position:0%
and if no one has anything else they want to

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.970 align:start position:0%
no one has anything else they want to ask or to add then I think we can call

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:45.790 align:start position:0%
ask or to add then I think we can call it a day

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:52.150 align:start position:0%
yes maybe if you have a few more minutes I have one question it's yeah

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.569 align:start position:0%
I have one question it's yeah about the non replay protection

00:51:56.579 --> 00:52:00.609 align:start position:0%
about the non replay protection if a transaction fails because the

00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:04.069 align:start position:0%
if a transaction fails because the call stack change will the nodes be

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:08.329 align:start position:0%
call stack change will the nodes be consumed or not

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.609 align:start position:0%
yeah the non-consumption is actually trick using

00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
trick using May

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.250 align:start position:0%
May need to think more about that in the

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.690 align:start position:0%
need to think more about that in the current implementation

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.049 align:start position:0%
current implementation nonce is basically tied to the top level

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:30.230 align:start position:0%
nonce is basically tied to the top level or try it's called

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.930 align:start position:0%
or try it's called which may or may not be the right

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be the right thing to do which means that

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.750 align:start position:0%
thing to do which means that it's something fails

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.390 align:start position:0%
it's something fails

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.230 align:start position:0%
basically okay if the whole transaction fails The Ledger state is completely

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.829 align:start position:0%
fails The Ledger state is completely rolled back those announced won't

00:52:48.839 --> 00:52:49.430 align:start position:0%
rolled back those announced won't

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.609 align:start position:0%
won't be consumed if a top level contractor tries succeeds

00:52:55.619 --> 00:52:56.809 align:start position:0%
if a top level contractor tries succeeds but

00:52:56.819 --> 00:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
but some subcontract call fails and

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.730 align:start position:0%
some subcontract call fails and the top level contract handles is Grace

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
the top level contract handles is Grace collisions and not smart Bureau project

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.930 align:start position:0%
collisions and not smart Bureau project thank you

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.809 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we we may need to discuss this

00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:14.329 align:start position:0%
okay we we may need to discuss this further because this can be an issue

00:53:14.339 --> 00:53:17.569 align:start position:0%
further because this can be an issue with like at some point

00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:19.069 align:start position:0%
with like at some point

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.809 align:start position:0%
the transaction fail and then becomes available again because

00:53:23.819 --> 00:53:26.150 align:start position:0%
and then becomes available again because the code stack is available again

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.329 align:start position:0%
the code stack is available again someone can just run through you

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:32.210 align:start position:0%
someone can just run through you and replace the transaction

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.430 align:start position:0%
and replace the transaction doesn't make sense

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense yeah I I mean the transaction replay

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.910 align:start position:0%
yeah I I mean the transaction replay but basically again frontrun is kind of

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.030 align:start position:0%
but basically again frontrun is kind of weird because it's it shouldn't be an

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.829 align:start position:0%
weird because it's it shouldn't be an issue most of the time because someone

00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:48.770 align:start position:0%
issue most of the time because someone would do what you wanted to do anyway

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.870 align:start position:0%
would do what you wanted to do anyway yeah yeah but what you wanted to do

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.390 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but what you wanted to do at one point may not be what you wanted

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.730 align:start position:0%
at one point may not be what you wanted to do in the future so let's say I want

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
to do in the future so let's say I want to transact with one with one inch to

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.569 align:start position:0%
to transact with one with one inch to spend my

00:54:01.579 --> 00:54:05.569 align:start position:0%
spend my money then these fails so I spend my

00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:08.450 align:start position:0%
money then these fails so I spend my money with another Exchange

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.569 align:start position:0%
money with another Exchange and then someone replay the previous

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:17.470 align:start position:0%
and then someone replay the previous transaction and spend my money again

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.349 align:start position:0%
like we can discuss this more but basically

00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:22.730 align:start position:0%
basically

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.630 align:start position:0%
yeah I think like I think this kind of brings another topic which is

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
brings another topic which is exploration which I don't think we have

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.250 align:start position:0%
exploration which I don't think we have discussed and they didn't do anything in

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.170 align:start position:0%
discussed and they didn't do anything in the proposal

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:33.950 align:start position:0%
the proposal

00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:40.190 align:start position:0%
it may be a generally useful feature to have you know for your

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:40.910 align:start position:0%
have you know for your

00:54:43.859 --> 00:54:45.650 align:start position:0%
signature to have expiration and that even could be a part of the standard

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.710 align:start position:0%
even could be a part of the standard payload so that we could distribute

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.069 align:start position:0%
payload so that we could distribute expired payloads

00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:55.190 align:start position:0%
expired payloads but yeah I think it's kind of

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.130 align:start position:0%
but yeah I think it's kind of complementary to our question okay yeah

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.790 align:start position:0%
complementary to our question okay yeah yeah the Norms could be Ledger bonded or

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.890 align:start position:0%
yeah the Norms could be Ledger bonded or time bonded

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.710 align:start position:0%
time bonded that may be a good idea okay yeah yeah

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.809 align:start position:0%
that may be a good idea okay yeah yeah we can discuss this and yeah it would be

00:55:08.819 --> 00:55:11.089 align:start position:0%
we can discuss this and yeah it would be nice to try to come up with basically

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:14.630 align:start position:0%
nice to try to come up with basically some Sooners and the sink they can get

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.890 align:start position:0%
some Sooners and the sink they can get abused somehow because

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.549 align:start position:0%
thanks Tebow so we are approaching time thank you so much for everyone and

00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:30.530 align:start position:0%
time thank you so much for everyone and Dima especially for you for prepping

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.569 align:start position:0%
Dima especially for you for prepping this and for answering the questions we

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.630 align:start position:0%
this and for answering the questions we will regroup and update on Discord

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.300 align:start position:0%
will regroup and update on Discord thank you all
