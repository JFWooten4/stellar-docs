hello everyone and welcome to today's ecosystem panel on fintech in africa I'm justin a vp of ecosystem here at the Stellar development foundation and today I'm joined by four esteemed colleagues weeza from chippercache joseph from dfs

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:59.999 align:start position:0%
lab rick from click pesa and tori from leaf global who are all here to discuss the fintech landscape in africa so they're going to talk about the challenges and the opportunities they see on the continent and in the world in general they're going to tell us about their companies and their personal journey journeys and hopefully they'll even share some advice for budding entrepreneurs so it's gonna be a fairly freewheeling discussion but we will do our best to incorporate audience questions when possible so you'll see that there's a q a button so you'll see that there's a q a button on your screen feel free to use it at on your screen feel free to use it at any time to submit a question before we kick off the discussion though we will take a few minutes to allow each we will take a few minutes to allow each panelist to introduce themselves and to give a little context about who they are and what they're up to and i'll start as and what they're up to and i'll start as i mentioned I'm justin from the Stellar I mentioned I'm justin from the Stellar development foundation which is a non-profit organization that seeks to support the growth and development of the Stellar network in order to increase equitable access to the world's financial infrastructure so at sdf we believe Stellar has the potential to have a significant impact in the world and we've also seen a ton

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:59.999 align:start position:0%
of interest in Stellar in africa which is part of why we're hosting this ecosystem panel our goal here is to explore the experiences of aspiring companies that are delivering digital financial services across the continent but also we're seeking to encourage those companies so in addition to this panel we're also launching the Stellar blockchain bootcamp with dfs lab in september we'll talk more about that at the end of we'll talk more about that at the end of the hour so stay tuned now i've mentioned Stellar a few times now to make sure everyone knows what I'm talking about I'm going to use the rest of my intro time to give a quick overview what is Stellar at a high level Stellar is a decentralized open network that connects the world's financial infrastructure it is a global public blockchain built for interoperability and to further financial access and inclusion and it does that by making money more fluid thanks to its speed and scale and ability to represent and transfer value it also makes markets more open because when financial infrastructure is connected you have greater geographical and affordable access to markets and ultimately it empowers people

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:59.999 align:start position:0%
because it gives them real ownership of the value in their possession so Stellar is a platform that allows businesses and developers all over the world to build solutions to real world problems and many of the businesses represented on this panel do just that they build on Stellar so enough about Stellar i will Stellar I will move on and let each of our panelists introduce themselves starting with wiza from chipper cache over to you thank you justin hey everyone my name is wiesa talakasi i am a malawian living between I am a malawian living between nairobi and johannesburg i am the vice nairobi and johannesburg I am the vice president of global developer relations at super cache triple cash is a mobile wallet the largest smartphone only mobile money service operating on the continent with coverage across eight different african geographies as well as the uk and the united states and we enable about 4 million users all of our jurisdictions to send each

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:59.999 align:start position:0%
other almost a billion dollars each and every year we've got basic peer-repair functionality both local and international depending on the jurisdiction that you're in we also enable users to get virtual and physical prepaid debit cards that they can have tied to their chipper wallet as well as purchasing some crypto assets namely bitcoin ethereum usdc a few more in the pipeline as we make our crypto trading platform a bit more robust fractional investing in u.s stocks air time and data bundles across the board as well as various kinds of bill payments for their respective jurisdictions we're a young company three years old but we've managed to grow pretty quickly over the last year and a half right now at 160 people we're building on stella's solutions to explore the viability of cross-border settlement with african stable coins a lot of the cross-border

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:59.999 align:start position:0%
trade that takes place in africa is intermediated somewhat unnecessarily by the u.s dollar and we think that we can take advantage of these stable coins to facilitate inter africa trade in a much more efficient and cost effective way fantastic thank you next up we have joseph from dfs lab joseph yeah hi thanks justin hi everyone I'm joseph head of entrepreneur support at dfs lab is an early stage investor in dfs lab is an early stage investor in companies for custom digital commerce we typically invest in pre-seed and seed stage you know anywhere from twenty five thousand dollars to fifty thousand dollars and we work with founders to help them understand their markets help them grow their users and also help them you know raise bigger rounds in the future over the last five years we've invested in companies like ochova

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:59.999 align:start position:0%
pula suppliers one pipe and a bunch of other you know companies we also run software and capital which is at least like basically an angel club that allows seasoned and new investors to invest you know anywhere from 2500 upwards in companies were also invested in so yeah thank you great next up is rick from click pacer rick thank you justin hi everyone my name is rick I'm the co-founder and director of click passer click pesa has a company operating in east africa since 2018 we provide a toolbox of digital tools such as invoicing crm and e-commerce solutions combined with payments to smes and freelancers in east africa clepasa is active in the market kenya

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:59.999 align:start position:0%
tanzania and rwanda helping local businesses perform better to increase productivity and profitability our mission is to simplify doing business for companies in or within east africa we've been building on stella since 2018 whereby last year on Stellar since 2018 whereby last year we became an anchor on the Stellar network clickbait is a small company around 10 people whereby most of company around 10 people whereby most of us are operating from tanzania and excited to talk further about Stellar in this panel looking forward for this our thank you fantastic thank you and finally from leaf global we have tori take it away tori take it away thanks justin hi everyone really excited to be joining the Stellar community again today you all have been such a source of support over the years so happy to be with you my name is tori samples and I'm the co-founder and cto of leaf global fintech

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:59.999 align:start position:0%
i am based in kigali rwanda and leaf I am based in kigali rwanda and leaf currently operates in rwanda uganda and kenya with goals to expand across the continent and into other markets eventually such as latin america and the middle east and europe as well we are a digital wallet that allows people to safely store and transport their money across borders different than other digital wallets though we really operate down market we started with refugees and have expanded into cross-border traders and informal merchants people that don't have access to the formal financial system they don't have bank accounts they probably have a mobile money account if they're in east africa but that's fairly limited in that it's very expensive and difficult to cross networks and to cross borders and so leaf allows them to store their money over time in different currencies to send and receive peer-to-peer with friends and family and other countries for free and they can cash in and cash out from and they can cash in and cash out from any mobile money number and the countries in which we operate we've also started adding in things like airtime purchase and value-add services into the wallet

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:59.999 align:start position:0%
and the best part is that it's accessible over basic phones so you don't even need a smartphone to use leaf we use a technology called ussd that brings the powerful Stellar based backend you know all built on blockchain into this really low-tech environment where people don't need to know that there's a blockchain behind the scenes they don't need to understand crypto to use our stablecoins and they don't need to have a smartphone or data connection internet connection in order to use our services fantastic thanks and thanks to all four of you for joining i think of you for joining I think so at this point we're just going to sort of move into a discussion and i think again anyone who's watching feel free to submit questions via q a we will incorporate them into the discussion when possible and i think generally you know we're and I think generally you know we're here to sort of talk about the finnscape fintech landscape in africa and to talk about these solutions to talk about sort of observations that the people on the panel have about what's going on in the world and i think i kind of want to and I think I kind of want to start broad

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:59.999 align:start position:0%
and i think the question that i and I think the question that i actually want to start with is each of you have a product that incorporates blockchain that targets a specific sort of user base how did you identify that user base and how did you decide that blockchain was a good solution to sort of offer them and i guess i'll i know offer them and I guess i'll I know that this will become a more freewheeling conversation but i think to start with i will just call I think to start with I will just call on tori since she was the last to speak sure and since she was the last to speak sure and we might be the most niche market play of everyone represented today so happy to start i mentioned that we started with I mentioned that we started with refugees and this became apparent to my co-founder not robinson and i as to my co-founder not robinson and I as we were really digging into the refugee crisis before looking at the technology side so we identified that there was this gap in the market where up to 80 of the cross-border market in africa is still cash based it's informal so people are crossing the border with cash in hand which can be very dangerous but then it also is just expensive over time it's

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:59.999 align:start position:0%
inconvenient and it doesn't allow people to move into the formal economy over time so we saw a the formal economy over time so we saw a significant gap there and in looking at ways to formalize that and to do it with a sustainable business we saw blockchain as a really good option this was early 2018 so the landscape was a little bit different but we knew from the bat that or right but we knew from the bat that or right off the bat that bitcoin and ethereum were not going to be a good fit for what we needed because be a good fit for what we needed because we knew that we would be dealing with small transaction sizes and a customer base that didn't have 10 minutes to an hour to wait to know 10 minutes to an hour to wait to know the status of their transaction and so as we started digging into different solutions we found stuller through a contact of ours actually in mexico and we found that it was a really good and we found that it was a really good technical fit and so we did look at other blockchains for sure and eventually found our way back to sellers started building out the wallet and during that time it was interesting to see how the regulatory landscape changed as well and the attitudes towards blockchain so if anything i

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:59.999 align:start position:0%
think over the last few years it's become an even better fit for us because Stellar makes it so much easier to work with regulators and central banks because of the stablecoin approach that we're able to take using our own custom assets acting as a by-proxy anchor for our wallet customer base so we also we work with licensed entities to hold and move funds so that makes it easier as well but overall i think the approach was but overall I think the approach was identify the problem identify who it touches and their unique needs and then find a technical solution to fit that need great does anyone else have like I mean there's a lot of interesting stuff there but before we sort of move on to talk about before we sort of move on to talk about regulatory questions and things like that does anyone else have like something that they can say or perspective on how they selected their user base or how they decided to explore blockchain as a solution for problems that their users face

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:59.999 align:start position:0%
how about so let's move in there so on our side we don't actually expose a lot of like blockchain functionalized to our users except for the assets that we will we allow them to buy and sell we will we allow them to buy and sell and send and receive in the app and we're adding a bunch of in the app and we're adding a bunch of Stellar assets on there very soon but like it's more of our operational backend right so you know in a good month we'll be moving anywhere between 80 to maybe 150 million dollars a month across african currency pairs it is very expensive to try and do a conversion to us dollars and then like convert us dollars back into whatever like destination currency that you actually have so like i can that you actually have so like I can give you an example one of our most popular corridors is uganda and nigeria both ways right one might not typically imagine that there's quite a bit of cross-border trade that takes place between those two markets but our data seems to suggest otherwise so we can find ourselves in a scenario

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:59.999 align:start position:0%
where today we have way too much naira in nigeria and the other day we have got way too and the other day we have got way too much ugandan shillings in uganda how do we quickly move money around across these currency pairs such that we are not unnecessarily losing money we are not unnecessarily losing money by doing unnecessary conversions to the us dollar at typically unfavorable rates so you'll find that like most forex bureaus bureau de challenge banks will not have like an exchange rate for the nigerian naira to the ugandan shilling but if you look at stable coin pairs you can find either a direct the conversion rate between the two currency pairs or a currency pair that's like a lot more cost efficient than translating to the us dollar typically something like usdc so it started making a lot of sense to so it started making a lot of sense to us very er early after encountering this problem that stable coins might be the way to go here stable coins might be the way to go here the biggest challenge of course has been around getting our partners and we work mostly with

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:59.999 align:start position:0%
banks in many markets to be able to move money around getting our bank partners to have a high degree of comfort around stable coins and how those stable coins are backed has been a bit of a challenge though we've been able to make a lot of headway we've been able to make a lot of headway and i think the future is promising what and I think the future is promising what what's most encouraging for me about it is that once the regulators and other stakeholders start to understand the cost benefits of using this approach and once they see some examples at scale of other countries and other jurisdictions where there's been a common sense regulatory framework that has worked and has not collapsed or created some degree of chaos it's very easy for other countries in the region to adopt and copy that sort of model and i think and copy that sort of model and I think it will be a much more different it will be a much more different landscape in the next three to five years across the continent

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:59.999 align:start position:0%
great I mean yeah for us it's been quite we also don't really showcase it to the user as in that since it's a similar situation and similar reasons as chipper cache and i believe i as chipper cache and I believe i wanted to add there that one of the reasons we chose the Stellar blockchain we chose the Stellar blockchain is also the i mean obviously the is also the I mean obviously the division of the Stellar development foundation which we felt very aligned with but also a lot of action which is also quite a lot of action which is also quite important so i think sdf has been over the last I think sdf has been over the last couple of years put a lot of effort behind building a good ecosystem so whether it be anchors wallets traders

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:59.999 align:start position:0%
more and more parties are coming to the ecosystems and the operations that the Stellar blockchain offers therefore are getting quicker and more efficient and it also makes it cheaper and that all in a decentralized way and that all in a decentralized way one example is for example adding of the usdc Stellar asset which was added earlier this year these are all great developments that make the ecosystem much better which benefits everyone that interacts with the ecosystem and yeah that's only getting better so that has also been one of the reasons for us that we went for the Stellar blockchain great and we're getting some good questions in the q a too and one of them questions in the q a too and one of them sort of touches on something that's come up a few times which is basically regulations and the question from peter is how have the participants found complying with the travel rule slash

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:59.999 align:start position:0%
wire transfer regulations and demonstrating this to regulators and banking partners so question about the travel rule and wire transfer regulations are there challenges in complying with regulations is that one of the big challenges that you face i guess rick maybe just you can answer I guess rick maybe just you can answer that one since you're on the spot still sure since you're on the spot still sure yeah the countries we are operating the cryptocurrency regulation is all very young and non-existing so we we've taken quite a pragmatic approach to it and you do the trial and error approach so for us for all use case we are an anchor for us for all use case we are an anchor on the network issuing on the network issuing tokens which people can buy or sell and

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:59.999 align:start position:0%
that fitted for us in existing regulation and yeah to be able to buy and sell you need a to be able to buy and sell you need a bank partner so we also regularly like sit with them and see how to adjust how we approach adjust how we approach regulation or compliance or aml around this does anyone else want to speak about sort of regulatory challenges or just regulation in general victoria looks like you're ready to go sure yeah and only because we get to go sure yeah and only because we get to have this conversation like five times a day with everyone right it's the first thing that anyone asks about when they hear what we're doing especially if we mention refugees just because there's a stereotype there but we actually we put all of our

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:59.999 align:start position:0%
customers through stringent kyc and aml checks at onboarding and then they're able to do transactions within the system but of course there are limits on that so i think there are limits on that so I think one of the advantages of building one of the advantages of building in africa is that widely there has been some regulatory treatment of e-money in the last 10 to 15 years of e-money in the last 10 to 15 years starting with in pesa and kenya and expanding into mobile money and mobile banking across the continent and so when we approach regulators to say this is what we're doing this is the approach that we're taking this is a digital representation of value that is stored and held with licensed financial institutions in fiat behind the scenes that sounds familiar to them because it sounds it fits the framework that they have for mobile money for example in east africa so i think that we've so I think that we've found a lot of success using that approach and it's definitely part of our growth strategy to identify areas that the regulatory treatment of leaf is going to be favorable

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:59.999 align:start position:0%
that's i think that is changing that's I think that is changing globally and it's probably going to be a while before every country has explicit regulation on blockchain or crypto based digital wallets but i think crypto based digital wallets but I think in the next five years there probably will be some sort of framework for e-value generally and so again the way that we do that the way that we do that is very important for our long-term success it's not just because there's a framework here or anyone can succeed i mean we've put anyone can succeed I mean we've put a lot of thought and intention into the design to make it work for the existing frameworks the potential for change over time and working within the maybe informal and working within the maybe informal political relationships of the existing landscape because it doesn't at the end of the day it might not matter only what the law says it matters who's already in the space and how what they're doing how they're being treated and so making sure that we can play nicely with licensed commercial banks telcos

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:59.999 align:start position:0%
psps payment providers or payment processors that's all very important to us and so our solution is very much meant to play nicely so that we can get meant to play nicely so that we can get traction with existing financial institutions and regulators because if it only works at the tech layer and it doesn't work in at the tech layer and it doesn't work in the real world then it doesn't work at all so i think that's been our so I think that's been our approach and all of that and it seems to approach and all of that and it seems to be working well so far at least in east africa yeah so just to follow up on you know tory and rick I'm was seeing like more well i say kind of opening up rights of well I say kind of opening up rights of regulators so in nigeria where i live so in nigeria where I live for example there was the brush you know kind of ban on just general crypto activities

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:59.999 align:start position:0%
and almost an extent of you know making it almost in a way criminal but then earlier this month we've seen the cba and the central bank say you know they're working on you know a central bank digital currency which is which to me is kind of positive which is which to me is kind of positive it's to me it's it seems to be like there's to me it's it seems to be like there's some engagement with stakeholders and then they're beginning to understand you know how this works and i expect that we'll continue to and I expect that we'll continue to see that across you know multiple governments across the continents it might not be like easy over like and as smooth as we would expect it to and as smooth as we would expect it to be especially in countries where you don't have the framework of mobile money or a money you know for context right and so well i believe it's going to be with well I believe it's going to be with the work that is being done by you know most lots of the companies like chipakash global will you know will probably see more friendliness from regulators over the coming years

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:59.999 align:start position:0%
without any insights on regulatory compliance and the challenges involved hopes plans dreams yeah i guess there's two parts yeah I guess there's two parts i'd want to think about the first was in i'd want to think about the first was in reference to like the travel rule so we've been fortunate enough that like a lot of our transactions for under the fincen threshold limit which was previously i think three thousand dollars is now being proposed to be as low as 250 a lot of our transactions are typically below that amount but higher in frequency so you know you don't have to be as stringent when following that though we do have like the infrastructure in place to be able to pass on all of the relevant parameters regarding the transaction so you know the address the name transaction amount the stated purpose etc so we can pass that programmatically

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:59.999 align:start position:0%
as parameters to our payment partners when they're processing so they have a record of all of these informations as and when the transactions are taking place so it's actually not that hard in terms of you know being compliant what is challenging is that the regulatory frameworks are you know highly fragmented across markets so you need to set up like a separate so you need to set up like a separate compliance structure in each and every country like of the 160 people that are working at your broadcast today about 60 of them are in the legal risk about 60 of them are in the legal risk and compliance team and you know this is like a very software heavy service like we've got like 40 engineers so you can imagine how seriously we take that and we found that like you know engaging the regulator early a lot of the times we have this almost perspective that the regulator is not pro innovation they want things to say the certain way or that they don't understand i think that's not the right attitude to I think that's not the right attitude to approach conversations with the regulator like there are people just as much as you and me I'm sitting just as much as you and me I'm sitting in the office of all of these central

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:59.999 align:start position:0%
banks but then their incentives are very different from ours and what is a the most useful approach has been demonstrating technical mechanisms which satisfy the requirements and the interests that the regulators have you know we've been able to set up this cross-border wallet in south africa one of the most strictly regulated financial services markets in the world by taking the surprise to say like okay guys we want to do this thing we know that no one has done it quite we know that no one has done it quite like this before but how do we make it like this before but how do we make it happen as opposed to the law says we can't make it happen you know so i think you know so I think by taking that fragmented approach and investing in those relationships early you'll be able to set up and scale quite quickly in some of these markets there's another question that was asked by afolabi in regards to crypto saying for crypto related companies like chipper cash will allow users to use btc on app cash will allow users to use btc on app how do you comply with local regulations so it's about understanding what the state of the regulation is in

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:59.999 align:start position:0%
that market and adapting as and when things change before the central bank of nigeria directive we allowed all of our users in nigeria to transact we've since disabled that functionality for those nigerian users in order to comply with the new regulation in markets like uganda and south africa where you don't have an explicit prohibition of crypto we're able to run the services and we are actually trying to help to formulate some common sense frameworks that enable the regulator to regulate crypto effectively and even in markets like nigeria it's important to note that the prohibition was it is not illegal to own or hold cryptocurrencies but the central bank did instruct centralized exchanges to not connect to the centralized banking systems so there's been very interesting ways that people have gone around that sort of like setting up digital and physical agent networks and we're exploring some of that in some of our markets to see whether it might

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:59.999 align:start position:0%
be a viable alternative yeah it's interesting I mean one thing that I'm thinking about as you're telling that story is that you have to be able to adapt to sudden change right you don't necessarily know what's coming next there's a lot of uncertainty and as new information comes in you have to sort of figure out where to steer and you have to be pretty where to steer and you have to be pretty nimble so i guess one thing I'm curious nimble so I guess one thing I'm curious about from all of you is like what is about from all of you is like what is the sort of most unexpected thing that's happened as you've been building your company and how did you respond tori do you want to go ahead I saw you come off me no go ahead go for it thanks yeah so no go ahead go for it thanks yeah so there have been like several scenarios where especially in our earlier days when we were like operating in certain markets and we didn't have a very much for compliance structure you know we'll be having the time of our you know we'll be having the time of our lives all-time highs incredible volumes and then your partner

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:59.999 align:start position:0%
processor just calls you and says we've received the cease and desist letter to shut down your services immediately like and it's like at 2 am right and like there's no explanation there's no negotiation there's like yeah you can come and talk about it next week you can come and talk about it next week but like right now we're seizing and assisting this because we don't understand exactly what you're doing and this happens this has happened to us quite a lot especially in the year 2019 it's really been a function of not like really having the right relationships and having the right structures in place to manage these adverse events as and when they occur something that is a bit counterintuitive it's a bit controversial but i'll still say it anyway it's my personal belief that a lot of the people in power sometimes the people in positions of power they might not be there because they like meritocratically earned that position right they're not like the absolute smartest people to be sitting in that role due to some other factors maybe there's like the president's cousin and whatever else they're sitting in some you know really

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:59.999 align:start position:0%
important position in a central bank or something now that individual does not necessarily have the exposure and acumen to be able to assess the viability of your business purely on marriage right and that is like a fundamental reality of the structures and institutions that we have in africa today a lot of people seem not in africa today a lot of people seem not to pay attention to the fact that african republics as an idea are about 50 to 60 years old and you're applying frameworks and regulatory structures from countries that have had institutions for hundreds if not thousands of years it doesn't really work the same so in a scenario like that in that type so in a scenario like that in that type of environment it is really important that you know the right people in every country such that when you get flagged for doing something those people are able to make a case on your behalf to help the other people who might be in to help the other people who might be in positions of power to understand that you're not actually trying to break the law you're trying to introduce a new level of innovation which is compliant which is actually helping some of the government and the state actors to achieve their intended targets and that is a lot easier said than done

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:59.999 align:start position:0%
but i think you know investing in but I think you know investing in relationships and making sure that you're always communicating preemptively has been very useful in helping us maintain this type of business across the continent I'm gonna jump on that because that's our experience at least the first part as well when somebody a partner just calls and says we noticed this growth on your system and it's become big enough that it's been flagged by our partners and now we're gonna have to put a hold on everything until we understand exactly what's happening and the reaction of course on our side is well we've been through compliance we've been through these conversations this isn't this is not a surprise it's great that we're growing that fast that we you know caused a flip in fast that we you know caused a flip in your entire system but that's that shouldn't be the conversation we're having today and so i think that for us it's been and so I think that for us it's been a matter of intentional duplication within the system to make sure that when that happens with one partner we can very quickly adapt and shift to another and so making

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:59.999 align:start position:0%
sure that we are truly an integrations hub with lots of options to keep our operations going and to provide flexibility for our customers is really important and then the other thing that i would and then the other thing that I would add i think the relationships add I think the relationships point is spot on those always help no matter is spot on those always help no matter where you are but also i think there's this there's but also I think there's this gap where again it doesn't matter at the end of the day well it doesn't only matter what the law says or what the regulations say it matters who is looking at those and how they're interpreting them and so we before we go into any market spend a lot before we go into any market spend a lot of time looking at the regulatory framework and what exactly we can do and can't do and what exactly we can do and can't do and we make sure to comply with that because we want to be able to serve customers and we want to be able to operate and we want to stay within the law but if we want to stay within the law but if you get somebody who is not in a position where that's part of their day-to-day job and they don't understand exactly what we're doing they don't understand exactly what a blockchain is

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:59.999 align:start position:0%
perhaps behind the scenes that's always a big buzzword you know they can set people's risk factors off and so if that person is the one who is tasked with deciding somebody's fate they usually are not the ones who want to stick their necks out on the line and to stick their necks out on the line and so making sure that we understand exactly what the law says and we're able to communicate that effectively to people who probably should know it but really don't has been a big challenge for us and i has been a big challenge for us and i think we think we're getting better at it but we still come across it all the time yeah it's interesting I mean well joseph or rick do you have anything to sort of or rick do you have anything to sort of add on this topic anything about the biggest surprises how you've dealt with them now for us it's been similar for us it's been similar examples similar fears of shutting down an account and i think especially for an account and I think especially for sort for fintechs in especially in africa

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:59.999 align:start position:0%
is that it's quite important when the product is evolving that you keep flexibility in your product and because yeah those things are unfortunately there and yeah if you can't respond quick enough you can't respond quick enough that means that yeah it can kill your business for a while so flexibility is definitely something you need to have as a fintech yeah definitely so in an area for my life i was the co-founder of for my life I was the co-founder of the fintech and these experiences are very like very similar where you have partners just basically in you know in our case you know we our customers just couldn't do a transaction anymore a certain kind of trans transaction anymore and then you know we reach out to our partners and like oh we reach out to our partners and like oh we you know we cut you off because you know

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:59.999 align:start position:0%
this the central bank reached out and you know and so yeah it's being able to you know have multiple partners constantly like wizard said you know constantly being like you know build relationships with both regulators and your partners such that you know it's easy to overcome you know times like this but yeah generally they'll just always come up you almost can't avoid them yeah i guess the this is also sort yeah I guess the this is also sort of a general question right if so far we've sort of been talking about the solutions that you built and the customers that you serve but i think there's also people in the but I think there's also people in the audience who are sort of budding entrepreneurs who are interested in hearing about your experiences actually building a fintech and you know being able to like sort of respond to unexpected circumstances to be flexible that seems like part of it but i guess part of it but I guess I'm also interested in any advice that you would have for someone who's interested in starting a fintech company or who's interested in

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:59.999 align:start position:0%
scaling one that they've started like what what's like sort of the is there a number one thing that you is there a number one thing that you would suggest to keep in mind if you're trying to build your own business yeah i can mention a thing yeah I can mention a thing it doesn't only fit on fintech businesses for starting businesses in general don't try to be everything and do don't try to be everything and do everything and i think in the fintech it's more important because you need to take off quite some boxes like regulation you need to have a partner if you if you're doing anything with financial activity often yeah you need to need various of elements in your business to together to work and i think

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:59.999 align:start position:0%
business to together to work and I think what is important there is to really look okay what is your core business what is your core business like where are you get in as a starting fintech business and try to outsource us as much as possible so yeah don't try to build your own kyc aml solutions there are multiple players in the market and then that's for those other activities as well try to focus on your core focus on your core and yeah utilize your existing solutions in the market in the market of course that's a little bit different when you grow but i think it's when you grow but I think it's very important to do that in the beginning I think mine would be similar to that along the lines of the core business team i think i would just say for someone I think I would just say for someone starting ventucker otherwise but especially fintech know the details because there's so much that technology can do

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:59.999 align:start position:0%
these days that we often forget why we're doing things or what we need to really be successful we see success stories in the news every day and it seems like you could throw any tech solution at the wall and something would stick but i think that especially for but I think that especially for fintech being in a highly regulated space especially for building in markets that might not have as robust of an environment whether that's africa or somewhere else it really does come down to knowing the details so knowing the details of your customers and their ux ui preferences and their needs on a day-to-day basis and their comfort level with technology knowing the regulatory landscape knowing your partner's comfort level with risk and any stipulations that they might have to adhere to or that they might be under so i think that the details are where it I think that the details are where it can fall apart or succeed greatly but

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:59.999 align:start position:0%
knowing them enables you to set up a business that has a much higher chance of success and then be able to effectively defend those decisions over time because if you're building in the fintech landscape you're going to have to defend every single one of the thousands of decisions that you make on a day-to-day basis to potential investors and partners and regulators and customers and anyone else who touches your ecosystem so i think as much as you can ecosystem so I think as much as you can know and be able to defend that the better joseph orweeza you want to touch this one well oh very you know very similar it's and it's like rick said it's beyond just fintechs right it's basically knowing like knowing your you know your product knowing what you're trying to build i think one of the

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:59.999 align:start position:0%
I think one of the best ways to put it will one of the best ways to put it will be to build the product first before the business right it's a bit tricky in a fintech especially with regulation and stuff but it's mainly in a way you i believe that you still have you I believe that you still have you have some room to ask for forgiveness you know before begging for permission right and so for as much as you can play and so for as much as you can play i'll say like you know just get make sure that you have a solid understanding like tori said of the product you're trying to build of your users of what they want of what is really important to them and in the same vein almost at the same time work on building very strong relationships with you know partners your relationship with partners will probably in many cases make or break you it's very important that you make sure that those relationships are strong and in many cases they'll protect you

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:59.999 align:start position:0%
especially if you're like you know a fintech starting out most of your partners are probably going to be the ones to protect you from you know like heavy hits from regulators right so making sure those relationships are you know are really tight and i think are really tight and I think wizard referenced you know kind of finding out what their motivations are and then you know walking around those just as opposed to beyond just regulators just your partners know where your partner's motivations are and make sure that you know you're working with them you know to achieve whatever they also want to achieve while you're achieving what you want to achieve so basically yeah is that anything to add no I think between what tori and joseph have shared they have captured all of my ideas great i mean one thing i all of my ideas great I mean one thing i think about as you're discussing all this is i think

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:59.999 align:start position:0%
as you're discussing all this is I think okay the Stellar network is a great back-end platform for sort of storing and transferring value and ideally in my mind at the sitting here at the in my mind at the sitting here at the Stellar development foundation i imagine Stellar development foundation I imagine that all these different organizations ecosystem participants would build on the network and be able to like interoperate right to be able to work with one another to forge partnerships to make payments across borders and across currencies but i also realized that that's a sort but I also realized that that's a sort of you know that's my utopian vision of how Stellar should work and I'm curious about your views on interoperating with other people in the Stellar ecosystem or in sort of the fintech ecosystem in general how important is it that your sort of solutions that you're building play well with others and what are the biggest chat like doesn't do they currently and if and whether they do or not like and if and whether they do or not like sort of what are the biggest challenges to interoperation

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:59.999 align:start position:0%
I have a bunch of thoughts on this one so i think one so I think interoperability is like the next big barrier for digital financial services across the continent we have seen relatively high penetration in terms of especially urban centers but like you know we still have a long but like you know we still have a long way to go in digitizing finance right network international who operates probably the largest point-of-sale terminal network for banks across the continent their latest data from last year indicates that 93 of transactions across the continent retail transactions are still in cash so all of this fintech we're doing is lovely and the volumes are impressive but like we have a long way to go that's one now we have a long way to go that's one now another side of that bucket is that different countries have got fragmented solutions on a per country basis so even in individual markets native interoperability is not yet where it needs to be there is not yet where it needs to be there are a few notable examples tanzania has got really good interrupt uganda

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:59.999 align:start position:0%
so and so I'm not sure about the latest so and so I'm not sure about the latest in rwanda maybe tory can chime in there but there's still quite a lot of work to be done on a national work to be done on a national level once we have the national systems all of the digital financial systems interoperable and I'm pleased to see that over the last three years a lot of the bank and mobile money interoperability problems in east africa and southern africa have been solved quite well have been solved quite well but once we have that national interoperability the next question is now around like international transactions interoperability and it was i think actually this week and it was I think actually this week that afri exim bank is piloting a continental payment system that is going to be used to facilitate a trade of intra-africa currency pairs like the ones that i described pairs like the ones that I described earlier this is consistent with the african continental free trade areas policy towards unifying africa towards a single market so i do think that like you know so I do think that like you know interoperability is probably the most important thing

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:59.999 align:start position:0%
we have to do at this stage it doesn't we have to do at this stage it doesn't matter if you know my money is sitting in cheaper and tori has hers in leave why can't i send my money from my why can't I send my money from my chipper wallet to tory's leaf wallet we both support the ron and frank we both support the kenyan shipping we have a long way to go some of the standards that are being developed the standards that are being developed such as moja loop could be something that's quite exciting but again they're targeted towards specific verticals that is the telco industry we're over the top financial service players if we don't do interoperability we'll end up with a scenario where you've got many monopolies in various regions which is almost the status quo to date so definitely something that needs to happen i think that blockchains are an happen I think that blockchains are an obvious solution towards interoperability i just haven't seen interoperability I just haven't seen i think that the biggest barrier the I think that the biggest barrier the technology exists today but the biggest barrier is fintechs in africa don't have like a unified association the way the telcos do so moja loop is the way the telcos do so moja loop is being pushed to the telcos through the gsma which is the industry association the first thing we need to

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:59.999 align:start position:0%
do is unionize and bring out an association of over the top of financial service players and then agree on what sort of standards we're going to use for interoperability i don't think it's for interoperability I don't think it's been as much of an issue in other markets because europe has got the eurozone so if the currency is natively interoperable you don't have to worry the united states is a single market china is also a single market india is also a single market but we compare ourselves with these regions and meanwhile we are 54 very distinct and very unique countries with unique needs challenges and opportunities so definitely i think the next unicorns so definitely I think the next unicorns are going to be interoperability platforms out of africa and it's a fantastic opportunity for those who are willing to give it a shot in solving i completely agree with that i think I completely agree with that I think the fragmented markets that you mentioned are the biggest opportunities as well so if the telcos are not going to solve so if the telcos are not going to solve that you know in rwanda today it's very

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:59.999 align:start position:0%
difficult to send between mtn and airtel if they're not going to solve it for themselves because of the competition between those then that's an incredible opportunity for somebody like leaf or tripper or other fintech plays to come in and solve it for them so i've been excited to see that there are definitely companies stepping into those gaps i think they've started at those gaps I think they've started at the business level so the b2b plays that's been a lot easier and then hopefully the benefits of interoperability and bridge plays will come down to the consumer level over time that's where leaf is trying to play of course and we see significant opportunity there and I genuinely hope that others will come into the space as well because it is such a fragmented market and it is such a fragmented market and there is so much opportunity i think one thing that I think one thing that is a potential barrier to interoperability is the word itself and so i don't know if it's i don't and so I don't know if it's I don't and so I don't know if it's helpful just to start with talking about integrations everybody loves

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:59.999 align:start position:0%
integrations right they're easy we know how to do them they're very accessible for most companies and so if instead of going into you know a room if instead of going into you know a room full of people and saying hey let's all become interoperable if it's having those conversations to say how can you and i integrate today say how can you and I integrate today and over time that creates a network fantastic it'll help us get there and so for myself you know i look at it and I'm myself you know I look at it and I'm like well great we already have assets for rondon frank's canyon shillings uganda shillings on the Stellar network that's very easy for us to push into chipper's wallet for example so you know if we want to have a conversation after this and talk about what that looks like great because we already have that asset i think that my asset I think that my fear in this is that we keep abiding my fear in this is that we keep abiding by the same playbook over time and so it's you know leaf created these assets because we didn't see anybody else out there who had them but you know that's that could also be justified for other companies coming into the space you know

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:59.999 align:start position:0%
if they're a new company in rwanda that have wanted to have their own rondon frank coin on Stellar they could do that it's unnecessary they should just use ours and we should learn how to just use ours and we should learn how to play nicely together but i understand the business reasoning but I understand the business reasoning and the fear that could create that landscape where everyone just continues to do their own thing so i think we are very pro so I think we are very pro integration and very pro interoperability Stellar is a good tool for that and i think as is a good tool for that and I think as the network is still fairly limited in africa but it's growing and we hope that you know by sharing our experiences and our lessons learned there's been a lot of them potentially we can help other players coming into that space as we're growing ourselves because of course we're still very new in the game as well we're still very new in the game as well great i mean joseph do you have great I mean joseph do you have something to add to that yeah so i really like yeah so I really like taurus points on integrations that's actually

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:59.999 align:start position:0%
that seems to be like a more or kind that seems to be like a more or kind of like friendly approach one thing so we talked about mojo loop one thing so we talked about mojo loop and so i've been kind of involved with that movement for a bit one of the issues you see is many com many you know startups that should adopt it all are looking to adopt it to realize that for example you probably need to have like a switch right in nigeria it's going to cost you a lot of money to have like a switching license right and then you have this thing where the startups say they want to come together and then build like one switch that they can use to connect like you know moja loop in another country there's like all that kind of complexity around it and so just starting with integration seems to me like a very like you know fair approach like you know as much as possible if lots of startups you

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:59.999 align:start position:0%
know puts together the exposed apis like to connect to each other then maybe that's that'll be like a great start and then we can start talking about you know connecting across different brothers like countries so that looks that sounds very you know plausible to me yeah I wanted to add to that will be interesting to see a couple of players in the to see a couple of players in the african market that actually try to become such a central switch for example mfs africa is trying to do that and then on the other side you have of and then on the other side you have of course Stellar which is try to achieve that in a decentralized way with as a non-profit having a certain

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:59.999 align:start position:0%
open source standards it will be interesting to see yeah which way it's gonna it's going to lean whether it will be more with a central party or it will go decentralized and i think it will take a bit of and I think it will take a bit of time but expect that at some point it will lean more decentralized on for example Stellar open source and having open source standards and actually yeah a central party or that's at least what i hope what I hope because if it becomes a central party one or two players then it's the question whether it really becomes cheaper great thank you so I personally feel like that's a great place to end this sort of dream of hope that these standards for integrations become you know sort of tend towards the open

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:59.999 align:start position:0%
source of course as someone at the sdf who is prizes for the someone at the sdf who is prizes for the open source culture and believes that this network should be permissionless and owned by everyone and easily accessible and that we should work together to create similar standards rather than having one single party own them that sounds great to me and i would love to see that happen but and I would love to see that happen but of course you know what is interesting is that what happens next is up to the is that what happens next is up to the people here and the people listening people in the world in general the people who are building businesses and also to their users like what is going to succeed and i think going to succeed and I think only time will tell but at this point i do want to take these at this point I do want to take these last few minutes because as i mentioned last few minutes because as I mentioned at the top of the presentation or at the top of the presentation or at the top of the panel we the sdf are working with dfs lab to sponsor a bootcamp and i just want to take these last few and I just want to take these last few minutes so that anyone to give some information so that anyone listening understands what that means what it can do for them and how to apply what it can do for them and how to apply and so i want to and so I want to thank everyone for their participation

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:59.999 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and pass it over to joseph so he can and pass it over to joseph so he can tell us a little bit about the boot camp yeah thanks justin so we're working so dfs lab is working with the Stellar development foundation it's to kind of open up an opportunity for early to mid-stage startups who are interested in building a solution for on stella who are interested in building on stella for africa we are looking you know at basically it's it they block the bootcamp follows like a you know design sprint approach where over a period of three days you go from over a period of three days you go from you know idea to prototype in where you follow a bunch of steps right to go from idea to prototype by three-day period and then we have

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:59.999 align:start position:0%
demo day on the fourth day where startups or participants can win you know anywhere from five thousand to twenty thousand usdc in prices so the most promising startups you know during the event and there are also opportunities for follow-up funding from the Stellar development foundation enterprise fund and other investors who at the boots got the demo day right and then and it's kind of open to fintechs open to companies that are currently building on the blockchain and then companies that are just you know thinking of it know you know thinking of it like the way we refer to them as cryptocurious companies who are building in africa it's open to so to any of those type it's open to so to any of those type of people to apply you can visit the websites to apply you can visit the websites that you see on the screen right now

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:59.999 align:start position:0%
the link on the screen to apply applications clues on the 20th of august and yeah if you have any questions about it feel free to email me that's joseph dfslab.net but I'm fairly positive like you know you have all the information you need on the website on the website so please feel free to apply we're looking forward to having you during the event great yeah thanks everyone so obviously as joseph said you can visit that link on the screen to find out more you can on the screen to find out more you can email joseph dfslab.net applications as it says close august 20th and our goal here is to sort of help support our goal here is to sort of help support and incubate projects in africa that are focused on fintech solutions that solve real-world problems and that's the end i really want and that's the end I really want to say that this was it was a real

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:59.999 align:start position:0%
privilege to have all four of you here thank you so much i all four of you here thank you so much i know that we just scratched the surface but i feel like we started to get into but I feel like we started to get into some interesting areas and to talk about you know what's going on in the region in integrations and also i think there integrations and also I think there was some really interesting nuggets for people who are interested in building their own companies or scaling their own companies so i really appreciate it and so I really appreciate it and i hope that everyone out there listening I hope that everyone out there listening also came away with something we do plan to have more of these ecosystem roundtables in the future so you can always find out more about those by just going to Stellar.org events thanks everyone for participating and for watching
