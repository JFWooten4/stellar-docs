00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.829 align:start position:0%
so welcome to the stellar open protocol

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.669 align:start position:0%
so welcome to the stellar open protocol discussion in these discussions we

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.590 align:start position:0%
discussion in these discussions we discuss and plan for

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.190 align:start position:0%
discuss and plan for changes to upcoming versions of the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.509 align:start position:0%
changes to upcoming versions of the stellar protocol um right now we're

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.350 align:start position:0%
stellar protocol um right now we're focused on project jump cannon which

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.749 align:start position:0%
focused on project jump cannon which will bring smart contracts to stellar in

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
will bring smart contracts to stellar in addition to changes to the stellar

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.950 align:start position:0%
addition to changes to the stellar protocol it will also lead to the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.349 align:start position:0%
protocol it will also lead to the creation of a new smart contracts

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.269 align:start position:0%
creation of a new smart contracts platform

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.790 align:start position:0%
platform and all of the discussion that we're

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.830 align:start position:0%
and all of the discussion that we're having about this is being tracked and

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.589 align:start position:0%
having about this is being tracked and and you can participate in it much of it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.349 align:start position:0%
and you can participate in it much of it is happening here on discord in the jump

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.870 align:start position:0%
is happening here on discord in the jump cannon channel and the drum cannon dev

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.950 align:start position:0%
cannon channel and the drum cannon dev channel there are also a series of core

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
channel there are also a series of core advancement proposals or caps that

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.350 align:start position:0%
advancement proposals or caps that relate to changes that would enable jump

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.110 align:start position:0%
relate to changes that would enable jump cannon or the new smart contracts

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.310 align:start position:0%
cannon or the new smart contracts platform

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.950 align:start position:0%
platform caps 46 through 55 i believe at this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.110 align:start position:0%
caps 46 through 55 i believe at this point they're pretty modular so each one

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 align:start position:0%
point they're pretty modular so each one sort of takes on an aspect of the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
sort of takes on an aspect of the changes that need to be made in order to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.869 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made in order to bring smart contracts to stellar and we

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.709 align:start position:0%
bring smart contracts to stellar and we are working through those modules bit by

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.869 align:start position:0%
are working through those modules bit by bit and discussing sort of the segments

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.029 align:start position:0%
bit and discussing sort of the segments necessary and the changes necessary to

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.189 align:start position:0%
necessary and the changes necessary to allow those segments to actually come to

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.950 align:start position:0%
allow those segments to actually come to life

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.950 align:start position:0%
life at some point all of the work that we do

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.630 align:start position:0%
at some point all of the work that we do will go through the normal process in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.590 align:start position:0%
will go through the normal process in other words caps are sort of uh

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.510 align:start position:0%
other words caps are sort of uh put up in this github repository that's

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.109 align:start position:0%
put up in this github repository that's linked to in the show notes they're

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
linked to in the show notes they're discussed here they're discussed on a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.230 align:start position:0%
discussed here they're discussed on a mailing list and they're discussed in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.510 align:start position:0%
mailing list and they're discussed in discord and uh after after they sort of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 align:start position:0%
discord and uh after after they sort of reach a point where they are stable they

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
reach a point where they are stable they move from being a draft into a formal

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.830 align:start position:0%
move from being a draft into a formal acceptance period finally they're

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
acceptance period finally they're accepted and implemented in a version of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.109 align:start position:0%
accepted and implemented in a version of the stellar protocol and before that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
the stellar protocol and before that version of the stellar protocol goes

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.190 align:start position:0%
version of the stellar protocol goes live validators actually vote to accept

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.469 align:start position:0%
live validators actually vote to accept it um now we are still fairly well we've

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
it um now we are still fairly well we've actually made a lot of progress in the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.069 align:start position:0%
actually made a lot of progress in the in sort of the jump cannon trajectory

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.749 align:start position:0%
in sort of the jump cannon trajectory but as of yet the caps that we have in

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.429 align:start position:0%
but as of yet the caps that we have in front of us have not been accepted

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.510 align:start position:0%
front of us have not been accepted there's still a lot of questions and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.149 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of questions and today we will dig into some of those

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.429 align:start position:0%
today we will dig into some of those questions

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.109 align:start position:0%
questions um if you

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.230 align:start position:0%
um if you who are listening actually have

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.389 align:start position:0%
who are listening actually have questions you can leave them as text in

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.230 align:start position:0%
questions you can leave them as text in the live chat channel i'll try to keep

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.830 align:start position:0%
the live chat channel i'll try to keep an eye on that um

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.190 align:start position:0%
an eye on that um we're certainly trying to move this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.870 align:start position:0%
we're certainly trying to move this discussion forward and have

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.069 align:start position:0%
discussion forward and have the substantive issues um come to light

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:02.789 align:start position:0%
the substantive issues um come to light so

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
so you know we may not be able to answer

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.350 align:start position:0%
you know we may not be able to answer all the live chat questions but we

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.030 align:start position:0%
all the live chat questions but we definitely will later

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.550 align:start position:0%
definitely will later if we can't answer them in the course of

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.669 align:start position:0%
if we can't answer them in the course of this meeting

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
this meeting so i think everyone is here and i think

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
so i think everyone is here and i think we are ready to kick off

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.750 align:start position:0%
we are ready to kick off um

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.470 align:start position:0%
um today i know that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
today i know that um recently there was a new cap cap 55

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
um recently there was a new cap cap 55 fee model in smart contracts um i don't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.229 align:start position:0%
fee model in smart contracts um i don't know if it just hit the mailing list

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.670 align:start position:0%
know if it just hit the mailing list yesterday there were a few comments that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.510 align:start position:0%
yesterday there were a few comments that came in i guess i'm going to start by

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.710 align:start position:0%
came in i guess i'm going to start by asking you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.830 align:start position:0%
asking you uh nicola if we're ready to discuss that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh nicola if we're ready to discuss that if that's where we should start

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.229 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah like we can

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.020 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah like we can maybe um

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.070 align:start position:0%
maybe um [Music]

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.790 align:start position:0%
[Music] like just go over like a quick overview

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.190 align:start position:0%
like just go over like a quick overview of like what's going on in that cap and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.190 align:start position:0%
of like what's going on in that cap and then

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
then um

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.229 align:start position:0%
um you know like we we don't have to go in

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.670 align:start position:0%
you know like we we don't have to go in details basically so i'm not sure like

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.110 align:start position:0%
details basically so i'm not sure like we need to need to have like a lot of uh

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.030 align:start position:0%
we need to need to have like a lot of uh of a pre-reading basically as part of

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.869 align:start position:0%
of a pre-reading basically as part of this

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.990 align:start position:0%
this is that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.550 align:start position:0%
is that good use of time of people yeah i think

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.630 align:start position:0%
good use of time of people yeah i think that sounds good also nico if you can

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.110 align:start position:0%
that sounds good also nico if you can you know obviously a lot of these things

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.190 align:start position:0%
you know obviously a lot of these things are kind of like normal quote unquote in

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.509 align:start position:0%
are kind of like normal quote unquote in the world of crypto but uh some of these

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.149 align:start position:0%
the world of crypto but uh some of these are

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
are a bit more contentious so i would like

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
a bit more contentious so i would like emphasize specifically like the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
emphasize specifically like the contentious bits so that we can have a

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
contentious bits so that we can have a good old-fashioned argument

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.030 align:start position:0%
all right

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.229 align:start position:0%
let's see uh and uh yeah i mean

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.789 align:start position:0%
let's see uh and uh yeah i mean so do we want to start with this uh cap

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.710 align:start position:0%
so do we want to start with this uh cap or i think there were there was also

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.030 align:start position:0%
or i think there were there was also like the events one that cida uh

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.229 align:start position:0%
like the events one that cida uh opened that is maybe a little more scope

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
opened that is maybe a little more scope i don't know

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
i don't know yeah i argue let's start with the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.630 align:start position:0%
yeah i argue let's start with the siddharth one because it's less uh

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.949 align:start position:0%
siddharth one because it's less uh contentious and we'll probably be

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
contentious and we'll probably be arguing this okay great so we'll start

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.910 align:start position:0%
arguing this okay great so we'll start there we'll end up at cat 55 uh sit down

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
there we'll end up at cat 55 uh sit down do you want to yeah

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
do you want to yeah i don't know if

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
i don't know if everyone had time to read the cap

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
everyone had time to read the cap document i actually made a fix of this

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.789 align:start position:0%
document i actually made a fix of this morning

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.270 align:start position:0%
morning but i can give a quick uh overview of it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.070 align:start position:0%
but i can give a quick uh overview of it and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.509 align:start position:0%
and you can uh

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.190 align:start position:0%
you can uh we can discuss after that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.429 align:start position:0%
we can discuss after that so i made uh i added this this change on

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.589 align:start position:0%
so i made uh i added this this change on to cap 51 which is the host functions

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
to cap 51 which is the host functions cap

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.869 align:start position:0%
cap i just added uh

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
i just added uh the ability for contracts to log

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.069 align:start position:0%
the ability for contracts to log data so i added a contract logs back to

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.670 align:start position:0%
data so i added a contract logs back to the transaction meta

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
the transaction meta um and as a part of this change i we

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
um and as a part of this change i we also moved the transaction result into

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.030 align:start position:0%
also moved the transaction result into the meta as well

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.590 align:start position:0%
the meta as well both contracts so both contract logs and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
both contracts so both contract logs and transact transaction results are hashed

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.909 align:start position:0%
transact transaction results are hashed and a hash of these hashes are stored in

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.909 align:start position:0%
and a hash of these hashes are stored in the transaction result pair which is uh

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.350 align:start position:0%
the transaction result pair which is uh this is how you would cryptographically

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
this is how you would cryptographically verify them

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.749 align:start position:0%
verify them and one change i haven't made to the

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.590 align:start position:0%
and one change i haven't made to the document yet but we talked about

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.670 align:start position:0%
document yet but we talked about yesterday was that uh we're gonna add

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.629 align:start position:0%
yesterday was that uh we're gonna add another

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
another contract log type uh where the logs are

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.150 align:start position:0%
contract log type uh where the logs are only emitted if there's an error

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
only emitted if there's an error um so that's a very high high level

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
um so that's a very high high level overview are there any questions

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
i guess like those logs they are like uh

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.710 align:start position:0%
i guess like those logs they are like uh logs that are like the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
logs that are like the equivalent to

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.070 align:start position:0%
equivalent to events in ethereum

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
uh

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah so they well

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.310 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so they well so the way it would work is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
so the way it would work is uh

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh you know that the contracts allow

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.390 align:start position:0%
you know that the contracts allow whatever they want since it gets sent to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
whatever they want since it gets sent to core

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
core or write some transaction meta and

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.189 align:start position:0%
or write some transaction meta and horizon can serve them up

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
horizon can serve them up in any way you want so i i was i would

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
in any way you want so i i was i would imagine that you know if you want to

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
imagine that you know if you want to listen to a specific event

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.749 align:start position:0%
listen to a specific event uh horizon would provide that ability

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.029 align:start position:0%
uh horizon would provide that ability allowing you to you know write

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.390 align:start position:0%
allowing you to you know write applications that

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:0%
applications that would hook on to specific events

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.909 align:start position:0%
so one thing that i want to

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.150 align:start position:0%
so one thing that i want to point out here is that

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.749 align:start position:0%
point out here is that it basically means that in order to sift

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.710 align:start position:0%
it basically means that in order to sift through

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.670 align:start position:0%
through um

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
um data coming in from uh horizon as as an

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.110 align:start position:0%
data coming in from uh horizon as as an ingestor you need to basically

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
ingestor you need to basically read everything

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.950 align:start position:0%
read everything which may become a lot

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.189 align:start position:0%
which may become a lot as as the network grows in capacity um

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.990 align:start position:0%
as as the network grows in capacity um ethereum has this concept of this uh

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.110 align:start position:0%
ethereum has this concept of this uh uh bloom filter uh that's included in

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
uh bloom filter uh that's included in every ledger header so that you can

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.390 align:start position:0%
every ledger header so that you can actually

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.230 align:start position:0%
actually uh

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.070 align:start position:0%
uh get a like a strong indicator whether or

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
get a like a strong indicator whether or not the smart contract that you're

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.830 align:start position:0%
not the smart contract that you're interested in or the the account that

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.350 align:start position:0%
interested in or the the account that you're interested in

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.550 align:start position:0%
you're interested in is actually included uh or has emitted

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.270 align:start position:0%
is actually included uh or has emitted events in that specific block

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.590 align:start position:0%
events in that specific block um should we consider doing something

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.830 align:start position:0%
um should we consider doing something similar

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.469 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i don't think uh i can't think

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i i don't think uh i can't think off top of my head why we wouldn't do um

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.790 align:start position:0%
optimize like that that's that area

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
optimize like that that's that area i'm sorry i can look into that i got i

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i can look into that i got i don't think i i don't see i don't think

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.189 align:start position:0%
don't think i i don't see i don't think i see anything uh wrong with that

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.029 align:start position:0%
i see anything uh wrong with that well actually i think it's kind of uh

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.469 align:start position:0%
well actually i think it's kind of uh maybe like

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.469 align:start position:0%
maybe like premature optimization type of situation

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.270 align:start position:0%
premature optimization type of situation like there are probably better ways to

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.270 align:start position:0%
like there are probably better ways to do it than doing this kind of arbitrary

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
do it than doing this kind of arbitrary broom filter thing uh

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.550 align:start position:0%
broom filter thing uh uh like

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.150 align:start position:0%
uh like you know i can imagine for example like

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.629 align:start position:0%
you know i can imagine for example like we have just made a stream uh you could

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
we have just made a stream uh you could have horizon

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.909 align:start position:0%
have horizon telco which which

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
telco which which filters it wants to apply instead of

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.150 align:start position:0%
filters it wants to apply instead of kind of doing it after the fact

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.909 align:start position:0%
kind of doing it after the fact and then the mirror would be a subset of

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
and then the mirror would be a subset of the meta like maybe like you're not

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
the meta like maybe like you're not interested in

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.390 align:start position:0%
interested in ledger changes let's say

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.830 align:start position:0%
ledger changes let's say maybe you're not interested in classic

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.430 align:start position:0%
maybe you're not interested in classic transactions you know like all those

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.189 align:start position:0%
transactions you know like all those things

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.990 align:start position:0%
things well you're you're assuming a horizon

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
well you're you're assuming a horizon here and i think that's like part well

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
here and i think that's like part well there's always a consumer right of

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.430 align:start position:0%
but if you want something that's like an

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
but if you want something that's like an application specific consumer

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.589 align:start position:0%
application specific consumer um which you do see in other ecosystems

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:54.629 align:start position:0%
um which you do see in other ecosystems quite a bit

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um you know if i'm developing a dap

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.629 align:start position:0%
um you know if i'm developing a dap and i want to have a

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
and i want to have a you know like a stream coming in of my

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.510 align:start position:0%
you know like a stream coming in of my of my specific information why should i

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.909 align:start position:0%
of my specific information why should i run a full-blown horizon

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
run a full-blown horizon rather than some sort of a light client

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
rather than some sort of a light client that could just

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.070 align:start position:0%
that could just uh you know share

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
uh you know share logs that are specifically relevant to

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:18.710 align:start position:0%
logs that are specifically relevant to me

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
and that's again like a subscriber

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
and that's again like a subscriber i don't see why this is like part of

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
i don't see why this is like part of this gap

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.749 align:start position:0%
this gap well i'm not saying i'm not saying it's

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
well i'm not saying i'm not saying it's part of this cap but i am saying like is

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.029 align:start position:0%
part of this cap but i am saying like is is there a place in the in the protocol

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
is there a place in the in the protocol uh to to optimize for these use cases

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
uh to to optimize for these use cases because we actually want more people

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
because we actually want more people to run

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.469 align:start position:0%
to run nodes

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
nodes and

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.589 align:start position:0%
and uh what we're doing here right now is

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.910 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here right now is that we're like really tying them down

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
that we're like really tying them down to like the the horizon model

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
to like the the horizon model which is consume everything

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.590 align:start position:0%
which is consume everything in just everything

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.310 align:start position:0%
in just everything no

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.590 align:start position:0%
no like horizon doesn't force you into

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.310 align:start position:0%
like horizon doesn't force you into uh

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.310 align:start position:0%
uh consuming everything

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.070 align:start position:0%
consuming everything you're you're getting the entire meta

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting the entire meta and then you filter it yes uh like is

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
and then you filter it yes uh like is the is the amount of meta being produced

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.790 align:start position:0%
the is the amount of meta being produced going to be a bottleneck in the you know

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.949 align:start position:0%
going to be a bottleneck in the you know even in the middle

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
even in the middle you know

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
you know medium

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.070 align:start position:0%
medium term i

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
term i don't think so

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
don't think so like you know xdr is fairly efficient

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
like i would like to see the actual

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
like i would like to see the actual performance problems before

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
performance problems before picking arbitrary type of

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.389 align:start position:0%
picking arbitrary type of filtering technology

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
filtering technology because i don't know what the use cases

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.190 align:start position:0%
because i don't know what the use cases are like you're saying they are events

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.870 align:start position:0%
are like you're saying they are events yeah sure then

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
yeah sure then you just keep advance it's a very small

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
you just keep advance it's a very small subset actually of the of the media

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.190 align:start position:0%
subset actually of the of the media stream

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
is anything that we're adding here in

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
is anything that we're adding here in this cap prevent us from adding a bloom

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
this cap prevent us from adding a bloom filter or other sort of strategies in

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.670 align:start position:0%
filter or other sort of strategies in the future i don't i don't think so but

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.509 align:start position:0%
the future i don't i don't think so but yeah you can do any kind of filtering i

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
yeah you can do any kind of filtering i mean

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.949 align:start position:0%
mean i think the the

00:09:56.959 --> 00:09:59.190 align:start position:0%
i think the the the place where i can see having an

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
the place where i can see having an actual bottleneck in the future is the

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.829 align:start position:0%
actual bottleneck in the future is the actual size of the

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:06.150 align:start position:0%
actual size of the meta may get too large for like uh if

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
meta may get too large for like uh if you want to run a light uh lighter node

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
but then we are getting into

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
but then we are getting into custom logic

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
custom logic in core to kind of

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.190 align:start position:0%
in core to kind of you know filter that somehow

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
you know filter that somehow and i think the the best way to do it is

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.710 align:start position:0%
and i think the the best way to do it is actually like when you're producing it

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.069 align:start position:0%
actually like when you're producing it instead of trying to do it after the

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:30.310 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to do it after the fact like with like uh

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:37.190 align:start position:0%
fact like with like uh like with the bloom filters

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.949 align:start position:0%
something that i don't see here when it

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.630 align:start position:0%
something that i don't see here when it comes to filtering is

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
comes to filtering is any way to filter beyond the contract so

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.710 align:start position:0%
any way to filter beyond the contract so like

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
like presumably the contract being out of

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
presumably the contract being out of filter up by the contract

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.670 align:start position:0%
filter up by the contract um

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.190 align:start position:0%
um is there because that would probably be

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.870 align:start position:0%
is there because that would probably be in the transaction matter

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.470 align:start position:0%
in the transaction matter but

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
but um

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
um if a contract wants to

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%
if a contract wants to emit

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.590 align:start position:0%
emit a whole lot of different logs

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of different logs how would an application filter on those

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
how would an application filter on those specifically or or is that just too

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.430 align:start position:0%
specifically or or is that just too granular to micro

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.230 align:start position:0%
well at the moment uh

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.590 align:start position:0%
well at the moment uh you know the

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.910 align:start position:0%
you know the body is an sc val so if you wanted to do

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.269 align:start position:0%
body is an sc val so if you wanted to do that

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
that you would add the filtering in there

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
you would add the filtering in there um but

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.550 align:start position:0%
um but you know i think we would discuss this

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
you know i think we would discuss this okay like maybe that's not reasonable uh

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.310 align:start position:0%
okay like maybe that's not reasonable uh we should add a higher level filters

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.910 align:start position:0%
we should add a higher level filters above the sc bell

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.949 align:start position:0%
above the sc bell something we can consider

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.389 align:start position:0%
something we can consider yeah like that right now this structure

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.150 align:start position:0%
yeah like that right now this structure would make sense here yeah like

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.710 align:start position:0%
would make sense here yeah like originally i i i thought we would do

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.230 align:start position:0%
originally i i i thought we would do something like right now you have this

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
something like right now you have this uh

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.230 align:start position:0%
uh block type right uh system or contract

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
block type right uh system or contract info and basically if it's a

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.310 align:start position:0%
info and basically if it's a i mean actually for both of them you

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.870 align:start position:0%
i mean actually for both of them you probably want to have like an actual

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.509 align:start position:0%
probably want to have like an actual event name right like which is like a a

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.710 align:start position:0%
event name right like which is like a a short symbol of source

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
short symbol of source right

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that makes sense

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.629 align:start position:0%
i would i would i would honestly look at

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.310 align:start position:0%
i would i would i would honestly look at sort of what the subscription patterns

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.389 align:start position:0%
sort of what the subscription patterns that you see in other smart contracting

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
that you see in other smart contracting platforms are because they they have

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
platforms are because they they have explored this this space fairly

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.670 align:start position:0%
explored this this space fairly extensively and i think it's what a lot

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.910 align:start position:0%
extensively and i think it's what a lot of the sdks really lean on like if

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.389 align:start position:0%
of the sdks really lean on like if you're writing a dapp it's fairly common

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
you're writing a dapp it's fairly common for for it to to latch onto a bunch of

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.870 align:start position:0%
for for it to to latch onto a bunch of subscriptions so like however however

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
subscriptions so like however however they're normally doing it we kind of

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:55.269 align:start position:0%
they're normally doing it we kind of want to support those patterns

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.949 align:start position:0%
is there more anyone else have thoughts

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.870 align:start position:0%
is there more anyone else have thoughts questions suggestions is it sort of

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
questions suggestions is it sort of clear what the next move is for you here

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
clear what the next move is for you here siddharth

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.230 align:start position:0%
you move on to catholic

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
you move on to catholic actually like there is uh something yeah

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:13.990 align:start position:0%
actually like there is uh something yeah that i just thought about that i think

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
that i just thought about that i think you know from what uh

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.350 align:start position:0%
you know from what uh i think graydon was

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.190 align:start position:0%
i think graydon was asking in terms of use cases like

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:21.990 align:start position:0%
asking in terms of use cases like like

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
like are there expectations for example that

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.190 align:start position:0%
are there expectations for example that uh

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.629 align:start position:0%
and that's related to this filtering

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.389 align:start position:0%
and that's related to this filtering question um

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.949 align:start position:0%
question um that

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.470 align:start position:0%
you want to have

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
you want to have proofs of events that do not happen

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
proofs of events that do not happen so like positive proofs are easy like uh

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.710 align:start position:0%
so like positive proofs are easy like uh like like with with the proposal you

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
like like with with the proposal you have like uh you know basically like uh

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.069 align:start position:0%
have like uh you know basically like uh you can prove that a given ledger had a

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:50.389 align:start position:0%
you can prove that a given ledger had a specific event inside a space you know

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:54.310 align:start position:0%
specific event inside a space you know from a generated by a specific contract

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
from a generated by a specific contract what if you want to prove the negative

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.069 align:start position:0%
what if you want to prove the negative that is

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
that a specific event yeah was not

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.189 align:start position:0%
that a specific event yeah was not emitted in a ledger

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.550 align:start position:0%
emitted in a ledger is that like the type of things that

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.829 align:start position:0%
is that like the type of things that people

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
people try to do in other systems

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.750 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a question for yeah to

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a question for yeah to look into the

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
look into the what happened

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:28.829 align:start position:0%
what happened the use cases

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:31.350 align:start position:0%
yeah 55.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
yeah 55. let's move on to it

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
let's move on to it all right

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.910 align:start position:0%
all right yeah

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.750 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so 55 is uh basically like uh

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
yeah so 55 is uh basically like uh like trying to layer

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.509 align:start position:0%
like trying to layer fees on top of the various uh

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.389 align:start position:0%
fees on top of the various uh like

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:47.829 align:start position:0%
like resource uh

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:51.910 align:start position:0%
resource uh uh metering uh that uh

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.829 align:start position:0%
uh metering uh that uh started to get introduced in the system

00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
started to get introduced in the system so it's kind of a problem is it's a

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a problem is it's a little bit ahead of that because we

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.230 align:start position:0%
little bit ahead of that because we didn't actually

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
didn't actually finish all this uh like i think we have

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
finish all this uh like i think we have a the beginning of like gas metering for

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.710 align:start position:0%
a the beginning of like gas metering for example um

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.829 align:start position:0%
example um in cap 46

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:11.189 align:start position:0%
in cap 46 but there are like other things that are

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
but there are like other things that are not covered yet

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.910 align:start position:0%
not covered yet um

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.389 align:start position:0%
um so yeah this is uh so the test

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:20.150 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is uh so the test disclaimer this gap has a bunch of uh

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
disclaimer this gap has a bunch of uh open-ended

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.710 align:start position:0%
open-ended things

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.910 align:start position:0%
things um let's see and um yeah so so like they

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
um let's see and um yeah so so like they are

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.509 align:start position:0%
are where the cap uh

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.629 align:start position:0%
where the cap uh is uh

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.710 align:start position:0%
is uh covered there are like several aspects

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.150 align:start position:0%
covered there are like several aspects kind of uh

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.629 align:start position:0%
kind of uh maybe like more important to discuss uh

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.389 align:start position:0%
maybe like more important to discuss uh i think um

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.749 align:start position:0%
i think um there's the the first one around

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
there's the the first one around the uh

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
the uh classification of resources and having

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
classification of resources and having market dynamics uh based on those

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.150 align:start position:0%
market dynamics uh based on those resource types so this is an area where

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
resource types so this is an area where um

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.629 align:start position:0%
um if you look at uh other blockchains it's

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:01.110 align:start position:0%
if you look at uh other blockchains it's actually a mix of things

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
actually a mix of things like some systems

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
like some systems um like historically started with just

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.230 align:start position:0%
um like historically started with just like ethereum um just like gas as being

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.509 align:start position:0%
like ethereum um just like gas as being the uh

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:14.230 align:start position:0%
the uh yes i i i'm also a gas

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.790 align:start position:0%
yes i i i'm also a gas in the context in this context meaning

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.230 align:start position:0%
in the context in this context meaning um

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.350 align:start position:0%
um the

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.189 align:start position:0%
the kind of this uh

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:24.310 align:start position:0%
kind of this uh metric right that allows to to

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.310 align:start position:0%
metric right that allows to to to kind of uh

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.670 align:start position:0%
to kind of uh count the cost of a um to to execute a

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.629 align:start position:0%
count the cost of a um to to execute a transaction and cost here is kind of a

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.829 align:start position:0%
transaction and cost here is kind of a pretty loose in terms of

00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:37.269 align:start position:0%
pretty loose in terms of definition um

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.310 align:start position:0%
definition um uh

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
uh like mostly computation but when you do

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
like mostly computation but when you do like when you load like a

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.150 align:start position:0%
like when you load like a like a ledger entry uh like when you

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.350 align:start position:0%
like a ledger entry uh like when you access ledger you also

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
pay for for gas

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.749 align:start position:0%
pay for for gas um and then yeah like yeah and then so

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
um and then yeah like yeah and then so you have like gas cost which is

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.230 align:start position:0%
you have like gas cost which is uh this aggregate metric

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.949 align:start position:0%
uh this aggregate metric basically of multiple resource types and

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:04.230 align:start position:0%
basically of multiple resource types and then uh more recently in ethereum there

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.870 align:start position:0%
then uh more recently in ethereum there have been discussions around uh

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.429 align:start position:0%
have been discussions around uh other types of resources that are kind

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.189 align:start position:0%
other types of resources that are kind of interesting

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
of interesting um such as uh bandwidth

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
um such as uh bandwidth uh and uh and any other like basically

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and any other like basically you have a kind of a

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.029 align:start position:0%
you have a kind of a funny

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.710 align:start position:0%
funny crossroad there that is

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.390 align:start position:0%
crossroad there that is do i want to

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
do i want to have uh a market for

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.430 align:start position:0%
have uh a market for uh

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.590 align:start position:0%
uh for each of those resources or do i want

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.430 align:start position:0%
for each of those resources or do i want to kind of generate like a composite

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
to kind of generate like a composite market

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.549 align:start position:0%
market for those so like the

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
you have like uh i think in

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0%
you have like uh i think in polkadot what they do is uh they put a

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.669 align:start position:0%
polkadot what they do is uh they put a the aggregation with utilities with a

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:50.470 align:start position:0%
the aggregation with utilities with a polynomial uh function so basically take

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.549 align:start position:0%
polynomial uh function so basically take all those resource types and then you

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.150 align:start position:0%
all those resource types and then you assign them

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.430 align:start position:0%
assign them um

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
um a weight actually it's not even i think

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.909 align:start position:0%
a weight actually it's not even i think they are linear it's a linear

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
they are linear it's a linear thing

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.789 align:start position:0%
thing and then yeah you combine all those

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:06.470 align:start position:0%
and then yeah you combine all those things and you get with your synthetic

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
things and you get with your synthetic i don't remember how they call it weight

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
i don't remember how they call it weight i think in

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.270 align:start position:0%
in

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.510 align:start position:0%
in over there but like um yeah like that's

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.909 align:start position:0%
over there but like um yeah like that's that's a way to kind of compute this

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:19.430 align:start position:0%
that's a way to kind of compute this aggregate gas

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.029 align:start position:0%
aggregate gas so the challenge um so to talking about

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.470 align:start position:0%
so the challenge um so to talking about challenges that comes with those

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.789 align:start position:0%
challenges that comes with those aggregate uh models is that it's

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:29.669 align:start position:0%
aggregate uh models is that it's actually very hard to discover price of

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.590 align:start position:0%
actually very hard to discover price of things

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.470 align:start position:0%
things like uh an example is uh

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
like uh an example is uh um

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.789 align:start position:0%
um if you take a

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:39.830 align:start position:0%
if you take a transaction that does a lot of i o and

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.789 align:start position:0%
transaction that does a lot of i o and very little compute

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:45.750 align:start position:0%
very little compute that is competing with a transaction

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.909 align:start position:0%
that is competing with a transaction that does very little i o but a lot of

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
that does very little i o but a lot of compute

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:51.029 align:start position:0%
compute like

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.390 align:start position:0%
like uh

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
uh with those aggregate functions uh

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.310 align:start position:0%
with those aggregate functions uh if try to pay

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.789 align:start position:0%
if try to pay like 10 times more for example bid more

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
like 10 times more for example bid more right for

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.510 align:start position:0%
right for one transaction

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
one transaction um

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.070 align:start position:0%
you don't know if you're signaling that

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
you don't know if you're signaling that you're that your i o is is what you want

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
you're that your i o is is what you want to prioritize or if it's your compute

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.190 align:start position:0%
to prioritize or if it's your compute that you want to prioritize

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.390 align:start position:0%
that you want to prioritize um

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
um so

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
so yeah so it basically causes the

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.510 align:start position:0%
yeah so it basically causes the overall

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.909 align:start position:0%
overall prices to have like this uncertainty in

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:27.990 align:start position:0%
prices to have like this uncertainty in terms of like what should i bid

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.789 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of one of the

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.310 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of one of the the problems with those kind of

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
the problems with those kind of aggregate

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
aggregate metrics um so with that said uh with

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.470 align:start position:0%
metrics um so with that said uh with john cannon like one of the things that

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
john cannon like one of the things that we are doing is uh we have a very uh

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.830 align:start position:0%
we are doing is uh we have a very uh clean uh separation between the

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
clean uh separation between the different resource types

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.630 align:start position:0%
different resource types so io for example

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.789 align:start position:0%
so io for example when we read or write the ledger those

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:51.830 align:start position:0%
when we read or write the ledger those are done

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.310 align:start position:0%
are done basically outside of the

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
basically outside of the main

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.430 align:start position:0%
main execution like you can think of

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
before applying a transaction before

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.029 align:start position:0%
before applying a transaction before executing a contract

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
executing a contract we load all the ledger entries that this

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
we load all the ledger entries that this contract needs and then

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.789 align:start position:0%
contract needs and then it does its thing and then at the end uh

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
it does its thing and then at the end uh it produces potentially uh side effects

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.669 align:start position:0%
it produces potentially uh side effects uh that will be applied

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:17.909 align:start position:0%
uh that will be applied as like a post step

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.149 align:start position:0%
as like a post step that's kind of a logically the way to we

00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:22.149 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a logically the way to we can you can think about this

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:25.029 align:start position:0%
can you can think about this and um the opportunity here for us is

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:27.350 align:start position:0%
and um the opportunity here for us is that because we have those uh

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.350 align:start position:0%
that because we have those uh kind of completely separate

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.549 align:start position:0%
kind of completely separate um

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
um we can

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.789 align:start position:0%
we can actually dis um

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.710 align:start position:0%
actually dis um and and we also do it because of

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.470 align:start position:0%
and and we also do it because of performance reasons uh

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
performance reasons uh for parallelism but like because of that

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.870 align:start position:0%
for parallelism but like because of that we can um

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.990 align:start position:0%
we can um um

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
um we can actually express those markets uh

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.549 align:start position:0%
we can actually express those markets uh like uh separately and we can therefore

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
like uh separately and we can therefore i i think um

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
i i think um have like cheaper

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.789 align:start position:0%
have like cheaper fees overall because you can price

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.789 align:start position:0%
fees overall because you can price things uh properly so you don't have to

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.909 align:start position:0%
things uh properly so you don't have to do like

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:01.909 align:start position:0%
do like to kind of articulate inflate for

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:05.190 align:start position:0%
to kind of articulate inflate for example inflate the price of

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.710 align:start position:0%
example inflate the price of of reading data from the ledger because

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.669 align:start position:0%
of reading data from the ledger because compute happens to be expensive uh which

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:13.029 align:start position:0%
compute happens to be expensive uh which kind of

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:16.230 align:start position:0%
kind of would happen with the aggregate model

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
would happen with the aggregate model so

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.590 align:start position:0%
so in the proposal what i'm

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.029 align:start position:0%
in the proposal what i'm doing is actually

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
doing is actually i have like three categories three

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
i have like three categories three really

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
really brackets for fees

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.789 align:start position:0%
brackets for fees so one is for

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.950 align:start position:0%
so one is for gas which is the compute time exactly

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.630 align:start position:0%
gas which is the compute time exactly you can think of it as execution time in

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.789 align:start position:0%
you can think of it as execution time in in our model really because like i said

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:37.190 align:start position:0%
in our model really because like i said earlier we we have a

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
earlier we we have a full separation between i o and and uh

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.110 align:start position:0%
full separation between i o and and uh and execution

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.750 align:start position:0%
and execution uh so this one you can

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh so this one you can bid

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
bid [Music]

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.270 align:start position:0%
[Music] second

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.190 align:start position:0%
second market that i

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.070 align:start position:0%
market that i have in the proposal is for reading and

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
have in the proposal is for reading and writing to the ledger so here there is

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.590 align:start position:0%
writing to the ledger so here there is actually a competition for

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.149 align:start position:0%
actually a competition for uh there's like there are so many

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh there's like there are so many uh there's like a you have like

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
uh there's like a you have like constraints right in terms of a number

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
constraints right in terms of a number like the bandwidth to the disk uh

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
like the bandwidth to the disk uh subsystem both in reason rights

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
subsystem both in reason rights um so um because of that you have to

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
um so um because of that you have to have like

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
have like a market for that

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
a market for that and

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
and it is separate right now um

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.750 align:start position:0%
it is separate right now um and it is separate also because there is

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
and it is separate also because there is a

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
a interesting fee model for rights that

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.430 align:start position:0%
interesting fee model for rights that i'm going to talk about uh later

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.789 align:start position:0%
i'm going to talk about uh later um let's see and the third category um

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
um let's see and the third category um is actually something that is not a

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.669 align:start position:0%
is actually something that is not a market it's not really a market there

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:40.149 align:start position:0%
market it's not really a market there are dynamic fees

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:42.789 align:start position:0%
are dynamic fees for what i would consider like commodity

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
for what i would consider like commodity on the network so things like

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.190 align:start position:0%
on the network so things like um

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.230 align:start position:0%
um like uh

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.549 align:start position:0%
like uh producing meta or

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.390 align:start position:0%
producing meta or data that ends up being stored in

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.390 align:start position:0%
data that ends up being stored in archives

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
archives those do not

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.750 align:start position:0%
those do not there's no reason to have like really

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.710 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to have like really competition between uh transactions uh

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.149 align:start position:0%
competition between uh transactions uh instead we have like limits per

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:05.029 align:start position:0%
instead we have like limits per transaction like basically we say

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.630 align:start position:0%
transaction like basically we say you can only produce

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
you can only produce i don't know like a

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
500k or something of meta right for a

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.710 align:start position:0%
500k or something of meta right for a transaction and then

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.470 align:start position:0%
transaction and then that's your limit and then two

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
that's your limit and then two transactions are actually not competing

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.990 align:start position:0%
transactions are actually not competing uh

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.430 align:start position:0%
uh you know against each other so there is

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
you know against each other so there is no

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
no need to uh

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.630 align:start position:0%
need to uh you cannot have a market dynamics there

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
you cannot have a market dynamics there so

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.230 align:start position:0%
so uh there are actually a few of those um

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.230 align:start position:0%
uh there are actually a few of those um of those resource types and because

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
of those resource types and because there are there is no market you can

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
there are there is no market you can actually aggregate them so they end up

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.470 align:start position:0%
actually aggregate them so they end up in one big bucket of like

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.310 align:start position:0%
like deterministic

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.549 align:start position:0%
like deterministic fees basically based on the current

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
fees basically based on the current state of the ledger plus

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.590 align:start position:0%
plus

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.390 align:start position:0%
plus yeah like the actual transaction um

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.549 align:start position:0%
yeah like the actual transaction um so those are like the three

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:58.630 align:start position:0%
three categories that we have in this

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.710 align:start position:0%
three categories that we have in this proposal

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:08.230 align:start position:0%
proposal any question at this point on this

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.909 align:start position:0%
i've been going back and forth actually

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:11.669 align:start position:0%
i've been going back and forth actually on this uh like a

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
on this uh like a should we or not separate

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.789 align:start position:0%
should we or not separate piece

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
we could go with one like i said one

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.190 align:start position:0%
we could go with one like i said one market but i think uh it pushes price

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.430 align:start position:0%
market but i think uh it pushes price quite a bit too much

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
quite a bit too much for like cheap cheaper

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
for like cheap cheaper whichever

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.310 align:start position:0%
resource will be cheaper

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.710 align:start position:0%
which is hard to predict

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.789 align:start position:0%
which is hard to predict do we anticipate that this will be

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:41.029 align:start position:0%
do we anticipate that this will be difficult for users to reason about to

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.710 align:start position:0%
difficult for users to reason about to like understand these different types of

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.269 align:start position:0%
like understand these different types of fees and to think about how to set them

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
fees and to think about how to set them so

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.510 align:start position:0%
so yes and no i think that's actually one

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
yes and no i think that's actually one of the things that's kind of interesting

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.710 align:start position:0%
of the things that's kind of interesting is that when um

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.190 align:start position:0%
we have uh already in the system a

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
we have uh already in the system a strong dependency on a pre-flight

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.950 align:start position:0%
strong dependency on a pre-flight mechanism so like before submitting

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.230 align:start position:0%
mechanism so like before submitting most transactions to the network uh like

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
most transactions to the network uh like they will have to go through a

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.669 align:start position:0%
they will have to go through a pre-flight endpoint

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:12.470 align:start position:0%
pre-flight endpoint the pre-flight is the

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.430 align:start position:0%
the pre-flight is the the thing that basically will um allow

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.789 align:start position:0%
the thing that basically will um allow people to

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
people to compute

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.390 align:start position:0%
compute gas for example to estimate gas for

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
gas for example to estimate gas for for transaction

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.230 align:start position:0%
for transaction uh in addition to that

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.669 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that um

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:29.909 align:start position:0%
let's see uh in addition to that yeah we

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:32.149 align:start position:0%
let's see uh in addition to that yeah we have um

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:33.750 align:start position:0%
have um uh like i was saying like uh certain

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.190 align:start position:0%
uh like i was saying like uh certain fees that are like that more like

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.110 align:start position:0%
fees that are like that more like dynamic because they are based on the uh

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
dynamic because they are based on the uh current ledger uh like for example like

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.830 align:start position:0%
current ledger uh like for example like a bunch of those things that i was

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
a bunch of those things that i was saying are

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
saying are like the price of storage in archive

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.230 align:start position:0%
like the price of storage in archive this is uh

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
this is uh voted uh

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:51.110 align:start position:0%
voted uh by the

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.310 align:start position:0%
by the or determined by the validators

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
or determined by the validators so at before submitting a transaction

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.390 align:start position:0%
so at before submitting a transaction [Music]

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.909 align:start position:0%
[Music] you have to know basically what those

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
you have to know basically what those parameters are

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
parameters are um

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.870 align:start position:0%
um and uh yeah so as part of the pre-flight

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.190 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah so as part of the pre-flight endpoint you basically get a

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.789 align:start position:0%
endpoint you basically get a an estimate for

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
an estimate for your the minimum fee for

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
your the minimum fee for for those categories

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.350 align:start position:0%
for those categories well in the case of the

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.230 align:start position:0%
non-market-based

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.029 align:start position:0%
non-market-based resources the the minimum fee is

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.909 align:start position:0%
resources the the minimum fee is basically equal to your

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:28.310 align:start position:0%
basically equal to your or very likely to be equal to to what

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.269 align:start position:0%
or very likely to be equal to to what you need

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:31.590 align:start position:0%
you need in the case of um well you do have

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.390 align:start position:0%
in the case of um well you do have markets uh it's more like today where

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.029 align:start position:0%
markets uh it's more like today where you have to decide how much

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:39.190 align:start position:0%
you have to decide how much do you want to over bid based on that

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.470 align:start position:0%
do you want to over bid based on that because the minimum fee doesn't

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.510 align:start position:0%
because the minimum fee doesn't necessarily translate to

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.310 align:start position:0%
necessarily translate to uh

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
uh to what the market is is willing to pay

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
to what the market is is willing to pay so you have to look more at historical

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.190 align:start position:0%
so you have to look more at historical data

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.029 align:start position:0%
data but

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:53.909 align:start position:0%
but this is like something we can uh

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:55.909 align:start position:0%
this is like something we can uh yeah that uh that like

00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:00.149 align:start position:0%
yeah that uh that like endpoint scan like a horizon can uh

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:03.909 align:start position:0%
endpoint scan like a horizon can uh can uh can expose right um

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
can uh can expose right um and having yeah having them tracked as

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.630 align:start position:0%
and having yeah having them tracked as separate resources in terms of

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.390 align:start position:0%
separate resources in terms of historical price

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.149 align:start position:0%
historical price uh allows you have actually something a

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:13.269 align:start position:0%
uh allows you have actually something a little

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:15.350 align:start position:0%
little more stable i would imagine than

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
more stable i would imagine than if it was like an aggregate

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
i think the yeah the complexity from

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.750 align:start position:0%
i think the yeah the complexity from multiple markets uh comes from um

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.549 align:start position:0%
multiple markets uh comes from um i mean

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.310 align:start position:0%
i mean one of the implications is actually when

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
one of the implications is actually when we

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.909 align:start position:0%
we construct one and say we validators

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:36.149 align:start position:0%
construct one and say we validators construct

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.149 align:start position:0%
construct a transaction set

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:41.830 align:start position:0%
a transaction set it's going to be a kind of a

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a kind of a multi-dimensional

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.789 align:start position:0%
nexa problem

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:53.750 align:start position:0%
nexa problem which is not great

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.430 align:start position:0%
but that's the but that algorithm would

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.430 align:start position:0%
but that's the but that algorithm would not be part of the protocol it's more

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.950 align:start position:0%
not be part of the protocol it's more like

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.190 align:start position:0%
like it's uh

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.590 align:start position:0%
it's uh if you have like five seconds to produce

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.830 align:start position:0%
if you have like five seconds to produce a block here

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.669 align:start position:0%
a block here that's uh there's so much compute you

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
that's uh there's so much compute you can span in assembling the perfect

00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
can span in assembling the perfect transaction set

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.029 align:start position:0%
yeah to answer original question justin

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:19.830 align:start position:0%
yeah to answer original question justin at the end of the day uh the you know

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.909 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day uh the you know the wallets should have an easy way to

00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
the wallets should have an easy way to present an uh like an estimated cost

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.549 align:start position:0%
present an uh like an estimated cost in

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.789 align:start position:0%
in uh an xlm currency that they can

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh an xlm currency that they can understand

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
understand and they can tell the user hey like

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:34.630 align:start position:0%
and they can tell the user hey like um you know this is how much more

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
um you know this is how much more you can uh you can

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.710 align:start position:0%
you can uh you can propose for that like they don't need to

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.630 align:start position:0%
propose for that like they don't need to actually understand the mechanics

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.549 align:start position:0%
actually understand the mechanics of how this works yeah it's true that

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:43.990 align:start position:0%
of how this works yeah it's true that when you over beat right like you're

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.750 align:start position:0%
when you over beat right like you're doing for example you say i want to to

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.630 align:start position:0%
doing for example you say i want to to spend like 10 more

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.710 align:start position:0%
spend like 10 more than whatever happened in last few

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.230 align:start position:0%
than whatever happened in last few lectures

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.630 align:start position:0%
lectures that 10 percent you can put it

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.110 align:start position:0%
that 10 percent you can put it i mean i imagine pretty safely across

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.950 align:start position:0%
i mean i imagine pretty safely across like those different those different

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.310 align:start position:0%
like those different those different resource types like the ones with

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.310 align:start position:0%
resource types like the ones with markets

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.549 align:start position:0%
markets uh because the assumption there is like

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:07.029 align:start position:0%
uh because the assumption there is like the they are priced

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:11.190 align:start position:0%
the they are priced accurately

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.110 align:start position:0%
but i imagine that more yeah if you want

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
but i imagine that more yeah if you want to really save

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
to really save like a it's hard to predict but like uh

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:18.950 align:start position:0%
like a it's hard to predict but like uh like if if there are like some of those

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.630 align:start position:0%
like if if there are like some of those like a gas for example becomes very

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.149 align:start position:0%
like a gas for example becomes very expensive

00:29:22.159 --> 00:29:23.909 align:start position:0%
expensive um

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:25.909 align:start position:0%
um yeah you don't like maybe you don't want

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
yeah you don't like maybe you don't want to be

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.430 align:start position:0%
to be as aggressive on

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:41.909 align:start position:0%
as aggressive on on the other resource types

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:44.230 align:start position:0%
um can i jump in with a couple comments

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.149 align:start position:0%
um can i jump in with a couple comments yeah um

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:48.310 align:start position:0%
yeah um so i guess so um

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
so i guess so um one it's um

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.430 align:start position:0%
one it's um uh

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.870 align:start position:0%
uh i guess high level it's not clearly what

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.470 align:start position:0%
i guess high level it's not clearly what this adds over

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.389 align:start position:0%
this adds over uh for having like a multi-dimensional

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.070 align:start position:0%
uh for having like a multi-dimensional optimization problem over the the

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
optimization problem over the the one-dimensional one um and the reason is

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
one-dimensional one um and the reason is that uh sorry i haven't thought about

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:04.310 align:start position:0%
that uh sorry i haven't thought about this all that much um but the reason is

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
this all that much um but the reason is that like

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
that like when when

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.269 align:start position:0%
when when at least um in the current execution

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:10.710 align:start position:0%
at least um in the current execution model sort of

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.990 align:start position:0%
model sort of everything like everything executes um

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
everything like everything executes um everything in one lane is going to

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
everything in one lane is going to execute sequentially right and so the

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.310 align:start position:0%
execute sequentially right and so the main like

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.389 align:start position:0%
main like resource that's that's truly limited in

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:23.669 align:start position:0%
resource that's that's truly limited in like a block is is time right and um

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:24.470 align:start position:0%
like a block is is time right and um it's

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.549 align:start position:0%
it's it like unless there's some sort of

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:27.669 align:start position:0%
it like unless there's some sort of weird

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:29.430 align:start position:0%
weird um interleaving going on between like

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.149 align:start position:0%
um interleaving going on between like transaction executions um

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
transaction executions um that's sort of the one-dimensional

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.789 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the one-dimensional resource that we have to optimize anyway

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:37.669 align:start position:0%
resource that we have to optimize anyway and so it's it's not clear to me why um

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:38.710 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's not clear to me why um like

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
like your example of like a transaction that

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
your example of like a transaction that does lots of i o versus one that does

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.630 align:start position:0%
does lots of i o versus one that does lots of compute well um both of them are

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.669 align:start position:0%
lots of compute well um both of them are going to take a lot of time if they're

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:47.190 align:start position:0%
going to take a lot of time if they're using a lot of one resource and so it's

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
using a lot of one resource and so it's not clear to me that um

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.789 align:start position:0%
not clear to me that um uh

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh at least in the current execution setup

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.269 align:start position:0%
at least in the current execution setup we have

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:55.029 align:start position:0%
we have um

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
um that it's uh we gain by sort of

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.750 align:start position:0%
that it's uh we gain by sort of allocating some

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.909 align:start position:0%
allocating some um i don't know

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:04.149 align:start position:0%
um i don't know resource to like i o versus some to to

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
resource to like i o versus some to to compute as opposed to just like looking

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.269 align:start position:0%
compute as opposed to just like looking at the whole picture of like the total

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.190 align:start position:0%
at the whole picture of like the total end-to-end time of the transaction

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.509 align:start position:0%
end-to-end time of the transaction um that said it it does seem like

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:13.830 align:start position:0%
um that said it it does seem like uh we it'd be good to like have some

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh we it'd be good to like have some kind of like price discovery

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
kind of like price discovery mechanism um for different resources and

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.149 align:start position:0%
mechanism um for different resources and um certainly like you want like an

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:22.149 align:start position:0%
um certainly like you want like an overall limit perhaps on like the total

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:24.710 align:start position:0%
overall limit perhaps on like the total number of ledger entries um

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.669 align:start position:0%
number of ledger entries um and so

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
and so um i know i don't think

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
um i know i don't think um sort of thinking off the top my head

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
um sort of thinking off the top my head i don't think it's incompatible to have

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.269 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's incompatible to have like a one-dimensional um

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.789 align:start position:0%
like a one-dimensional um like

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
like gas market and then like sort of price

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:39.509 align:start position:0%
gas market and then like sort of price markets on each resource in the sense of

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:40.549 align:start position:0%
markets on each resource in the sense of um

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:42.789 align:start position:0%
um transactions could bid like

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:44.310 align:start position:0%
transactions could bid like you know for the the amount of resources

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.990 align:start position:0%
you know for the the amount of resources they want to use and like the fee per

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.750 align:start position:0%
they want to use and like the fee per resource um

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
resource um and then you do some like filtering step

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
and then you do some like filtering step um but that's sort of thinking um

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.110 align:start position:0%
um but that's sort of thinking um very much off the top my head

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.269 align:start position:0%
very much off the top my head um i don't think we necessarily i guess

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.470 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we necessarily i guess high level i don't think we necessarily

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.789 align:start position:0%
high level i don't think we necessarily have to go to the full multi-dimensional

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
have to go to the full multi-dimensional operation problem

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.750 align:start position:0%
that's but yeah that's possible like uh

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.710 align:start position:0%
that's but yeah that's possible like uh it it just looked like uh

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.310 align:start position:0%
it it just looked like uh from

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.830 align:start position:0%
from historical

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.470 align:start position:0%
historical kind of uh experience right like a like

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.870 align:start position:0%
kind of uh experience right like a like i o is a huge problem

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
i o is a huge problem and um

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
and um trying to model that as time

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.509 align:start position:0%
trying to model that as time is actually making it's actually a

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.669 align:start position:0%
is actually making it's actually a disservice in a way to the to the

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:27.029 align:start position:0%
disservice in a way to the to the network because

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:29.669 align:start position:0%
network because you have like

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:31.430 align:start position:0%
you have like very expensive

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
very expensive uh

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh from uh

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.190 align:start position:0%
from uh like this point of view right like

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.029 align:start position:0%
like this point of view right like something that's going to suck your your

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:40.230 align:start position:0%
something that's going to suck your your disk resources uh that now stole

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.470 align:start position:0%
disk resources uh that now stole all your calls right on in a multi you

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.909 align:start position:0%
all your calls right on in a multi you know parallel uh

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
know parallel uh execution model

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
execution model um like store as in you know because

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.630 align:start position:0%
um like store as in you know because like i said we do all i o

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.470 align:start position:0%
like i said we do all i o early on and if you're actually maxing

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.350 align:start position:0%
early on and if you're actually maxing out

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.870 align:start position:0%
out uh your

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.870 align:start position:0%
uh your drive then

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.269 align:start position:0%
drive then you're just stuck

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
uh right i mean it makes sense to have

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:04.630 align:start position:0%
uh right i mean it makes sense to have um

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.950 align:start position:0%
um perhaps a limit on

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
perhaps a limit on uh

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.789 align:start position:0%
uh overall io i guess

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:12.310 align:start position:0%
overall io i guess and then there's yeah the other aspect

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.630 align:start position:0%
and then there's yeah the other aspect uh actually maybe if

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.710 align:start position:0%
uh actually maybe if we can you know like uh

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
we can you know like uh i don't think we're going to

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.269 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to necessarily like close on this

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:22.549 align:start position:0%
necessarily like close on this multi-dimensional thing you know now but

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
multi-dimensional thing you know now but like there's the other aspect of yeah

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.389 align:start position:0%
like there's the other aspect of yeah ledger size and rights uh that is

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:28.710 align:start position:0%
ledger size and rights uh that is actually another kind of key thing in

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.549 align:start position:0%
actually another kind of key thing in there that

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
there that i guess makes

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.029 align:start position:0%
i guess makes uh

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
uh io a little more special also

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
io a little more special also nico just to go back to

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.789 align:start position:0%
nico just to go back to to jeff's point like i understand that

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
to jeff's point like i understand that why i o needs to be you know priced

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.430 align:start position:0%
why i o needs to be you know priced significantly higher

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.830 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than uh you know the compute operations

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
than uh you know the compute operations but i don't necessarily understand why

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.110 align:start position:0%
but i don't necessarily understand why it needs to have like its own market

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.149 align:start position:0%
so the the pricing right that you have

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:01.190 align:start position:0%
so the the pricing right that you have is the minimum price it's not

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
is the minimum price it's not the market price

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:07.669 align:start position:0%
like when you uh

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
like when you uh market prices is uh

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
market prices is uh like

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.069 align:start position:0%
like in the in the ideal

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:14.069 align:start position:0%
in the in the ideal like what is describing the cap is is

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
like what is describing the cap is is trying to be closer to like the ideal

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.829 align:start position:0%
trying to be closer to like the ideal situation where

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:20.710 align:start position:0%
situation where um you can actually construct

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.589 align:start position:0%
um you can actually construct a transaction set that's going to

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:25.750 align:start position:0%
a transaction set that's going to basically be like right at the edge in

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.909 align:start position:0%
basically be like right at the edge in terms of the capacity that you have on

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
terms of the capacity that you have on your actual you know underlying hardware

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.669 align:start position:0%
your actual you know underlying hardware so like cpu

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.109 align:start position:0%
so like cpu and io

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:36.389 align:start position:0%
and io for disk

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:40.950 align:start position:0%
if we lose that visibility

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.389 align:start position:0%
then

00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
then you may actually allocate

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
you may actually allocate too many transactions to compute when

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.829 align:start position:0%
too many transactions to compute when then uh like

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
then uh like uh you know you

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh you know you you don't have like basically like the

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.270 align:start position:0%
you don't have like basically like the the

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.990 align:start position:0%
the kind of natural way of of uh of having a

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
kind of natural way of of uh of having a um

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.950 align:start position:0%
um a transaction compete against other

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.550 align:start position:0%
a transaction compete against other transactions that are paying for

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
transactions that are paying for expensive stuff

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.950 align:start position:0%
expensive stuff that's kind of what i'm getting to

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what i'm getting to like uh like if you have like um

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
like uh like if you have like um what was it like a good example would be

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
what was it like a good example would be like uh

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
like uh um

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.069 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know which one of those

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:23.430 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know which one of those resources would be more expensive but

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.630 align:start position:0%
resources would be more expensive but they are not going to be in the same

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
they are not going to be in the same order of magnitude let's say like a

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.310 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude let's say like a compute is the one more expensive at a

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.150 align:start position:0%
compute is the one more expensive at a given time

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.829 align:start position:0%
given time so

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:34.790 align:start position:0%
so you have to pay like 10 times more right

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.829 align:start position:0%
you have to pay like 10 times more right or 100 times more than the minimum

00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:40.950 align:start position:0%
or 100 times more than the minimum fee for for compute

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.950 align:start position:0%
fee for for compute to get to get into the ledger

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.750 align:start position:0%
to get to get into the ledger but your your

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
but your your your storage price

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
your storage price is also kind of expensive and by bidding

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.109 align:start position:0%
is also kind of expensive and by bidding a hundred times you also bid a hundred

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.829 align:start position:0%
a hundred times you also bid a hundred times on

00:35:56.839 --> 00:35:58.710 align:start position:0%
times on storage

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.470 align:start position:0%
storage and you're basically overshooting quite

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.829 align:start position:0%
and you're basically overshooting quite a bit

00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:03.910 align:start position:0%
a bit compared to the ideal um

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.589 align:start position:0%
compared to the ideal um model

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:06.870 align:start position:0%
model yeah i think i think the general point

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think the general point here is just that you cannot that in

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
here is just that you cannot that in reality

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.230 align:start position:0%
reality uh it's not the case that there's

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.349 align:start position:0%
uh it's not the case that there's there's just

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:16.790 align:start position:0%
there's just time when uh a transaction is executing

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.390 align:start position:0%
time when uh a transaction is executing um there there are two different

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
um there there are two different resources and there are different

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
resources and there are different contention patterns on them and you

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.150 align:start position:0%
contention patterns on them and you can't trade one for the other the the

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.750 align:start position:0%
can't trade one for the other the the the system does not actually trade one

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
the system does not actually trade one for the other like

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.950 align:start position:0%
for the other like if i if i for example submit uh you know

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.230 align:start position:0%
if i if i for example submit uh you know a hundred transactions every one of

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.829 align:start position:0%
a hundred transactions every one of which is doing incredibly cpu and

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
which is doing incredibly cpu and expensive stuff

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.069 align:start position:0%
expensive stuff um that that doesn't saturate the i o

00:36:38.079 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
um that that doesn't saturate the i o system and there's there's still no

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:41.270 align:start position:0%
system and there's there's still no contention on the i o system uh whereas

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
contention on the i o system uh whereas if i submit a 100 transactions that are

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.910 align:start position:0%
if i submit a 100 transactions that are just doing i o and they're doing no cpu

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
just doing i o and they're doing no cpu that doesn't saturate the cpu so they

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.990 align:start position:0%
that doesn't saturate the cpu so they are really two separate resources and

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.069 align:start position:0%
are really two separate resources and the point where one of them gets a limit

00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.829 align:start position:0%
the point where one of them gets a limit uh and can no longer do

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh and can no longer do transaction processing it

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
transaction processing it doesn't

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
doesn't represent a limit on the other and vice

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
represent a limit on the other and vice versa and so you you you can't trade

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.990 align:start position:0%
versa and so you you you can't trade between the two of them uh from from a

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.349 align:start position:0%
between the two of them uh from from a market perspective

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.710 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not quite following something

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not quite following something didn't didn't we say earlier that we

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.670 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't we say earlier that we were going to do like all of the sort of

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
were going to do like all of the sort of disk reads first and then do the

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
disk reads first and then do the executions right so that if we have a

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.550 align:start position:0%
executions right so that if we have a lot of disk reads then we have less time

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
lot of disk reads then we have less time for execution

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.349 align:start position:0%
for execution and so the vice versa

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:21.270 align:start position:0%
and so the vice versa i i sort of understand that there's not

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
i i sort of understand that there's not they're not like directly tradable but

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.470 align:start position:0%
they're not like directly tradable but they seem

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.430 align:start position:0%
they seem correlated or anti-correlated

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.030 align:start position:0%
correlated or anti-correlated well they're they're they're different

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.630 align:start position:0%
well they're they're they're different devices so like right i'm using the disk

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.349 align:start position:0%
devices so like right i'm using the disk and then i'm doing the cpu right i'm not

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
and then i'm doing the cpu right i'm not using it at the same time

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
using it at the same time i mean like sure there's different

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.470 align:start position:0%
i mean like sure there's different offers and things but um

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.310 align:start position:0%
offers and things but um yeah sure but the the execution

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.829 align:start position:0%
yeah sure but the the execution characteristics of each of them are are

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
characteristics of each of them are are different so you you use everyone uses

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.670 align:start position:0%
different so you you use everyone uses the same desk and then everyone sort of

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
the same desk and then everyone sort of farms out to multiple threats

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.030 align:start position:0%
right

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.069 align:start position:0%
right i feel like we're talking past each

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:02.230 align:start position:0%
i feel like we're talking past each other i mean yes one goes in in order of

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.390 align:start position:0%
other i mean yes one goes in in order of the other the two of them do get added

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.349 align:start position:0%
the other the two of them do get added together

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
together in order to represent the the total time

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.430 align:start position:0%
in order to represent the the total time but you can't trade time on one of them

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
but you can't trade time on one of them for time on the other that's what i'm

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:20.150 align:start position:0%
for time on the other that's what i'm saying

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
i think i'm not quite following but

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:29.349 align:start position:0%
i think i'm not quite following but that's okay

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
nico are there any other

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
nico are there any other networks and fee systems that uh

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.790 align:start position:0%
networks and fee systems that uh introduce a split

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
introduce a split or that work similarly those are like

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.550 align:start position:0%
or that work similarly those are like the two

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
the two like the yeah execution time and and uh

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.190 align:start position:0%
like the yeah execution time and and uh like compute right and uh and disc are

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.510 align:start position:0%
like compute right and uh and disc are like the two big things that i isolated

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.109 align:start position:0%
like the two big things that i isolated like the right side

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:51.589 align:start position:0%
like the right side i figured it would probably

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.670 align:start position:0%
i figured it would probably is probably not needed

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
is probably not needed so i kind of put a flat fee for the

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.550 align:start position:0%
so i kind of put a flat fee for the other ones

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.109 align:start position:0%
other ones like basically like uh um

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
like basically like uh um in a proposal i'm basically saying like

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.710 align:start position:0%
in a proposal i'm basically saying like we're okay with you know if you want to

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
we're okay with you know if you want to have like

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.710 align:start position:0%
have like something that uh

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.630 align:start position:0%
something that uh like if you have a transaction that is

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.430 align:start position:0%
like if you have a transaction that is very important that happens to emit a

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.470 align:start position:0%
very important that happens to emit a lot of miller for example um

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.470 align:start position:0%
lot of miller for example um but you have to get just over a bit like

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.030 align:start position:0%
but you have to get just over a bit like crazy on your compute even though you're

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
crazy on your compute even though you're not really that's not what it's about

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.829 align:start position:0%
not really that's not what it's about you have to find a way to get it

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
you have to find a way to get it prioritized

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.589 align:start position:0%
um

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:37.109 align:start position:0%
um let's see

00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:38.950 align:start position:0%
are we talking about this okay like i

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.990 align:start position:0%
are we talking about this okay like i think i kind of wanted to talk about it

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.430 align:start position:0%
think i kind of wanted to talk about it here is in your proposal you're talking

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.630 align:start position:0%
here is in your proposal you're talking a fair amount about state expiry

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.750 align:start position:0%
a fair amount about state expiry yeah

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
yeah before we go into estate expiration

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.150 align:start position:0%
before we go into estate expiration which i i know is a big topic i'm still

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.349 align:start position:0%
which i i know is a big topic i'm still trying to to reason about like the

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.950 align:start position:0%
trying to to reason about like the kind of the wallet experience and user

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.550 align:start position:0%
kind of the wallet experience and user experience of having having these like

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.630 align:start position:0%
experience of having having these like multiple dimensions for

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.829 align:start position:0%
multiple dimensions for for uh for gas like

00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:04.150 align:start position:0%
for uh for gas like what is the expected

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.750 align:start position:0%
what is the expected behavior here for

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
behavior here for um

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.550 align:start position:0%
um for wallets

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.870 align:start position:0%
for wallets to be clear right like tomorrow like

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
to be clear right like tomorrow like single dimension or multi-dimension

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.950 align:start position:0%
single dimension or multi-dimension from a white point of view if you want

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.270 align:start position:0%
from a white point of view if you want to estimate it's the same problem

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
right like it's like in the single uh

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.710 align:start position:0%
right like it's like in the single uh like a cost model like like you

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.390 align:start position:0%
like a cost model like like you aggregate everything into one you have

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.550 align:start position:0%
aggregate everything into one you have to actually

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.309 align:start position:0%
to actually uh you have like a function right that

00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:32.230 align:start position:0%
uh you have like a function right that just aggregates

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
just aggregates but you do have to estimate uh your your

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
but you do have to estimate uh your your bid for each uh things

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.150 align:start position:0%
bid for each uh things so it's not uh it's actually like a

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.630 align:start position:0%
so it's not uh it's actually like a funny thing that

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.790 align:start position:0%
funny thing that that you have except maybe the tools you

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
that you have except maybe the tools you have for discovering price are not as

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.710 align:start position:0%
have for discovering price are not as great

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.589 align:start position:0%
great because it's all implicit

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.589 align:start position:0%
because it's all implicit okay so so a wallet can can do a

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
okay so so a wallet can can do a pre-flight can tell me like the expected

00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.630 align:start position:0%
pre-flight can tell me like the expected cost

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.150 align:start position:0%
cost i can

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.510 align:start position:0%
i can um

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.190 align:start position:0%
um you know

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
you know bid

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.790 align:start position:0%
bid bit over um

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.309 align:start position:0%
but how do i know how to divide that

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:16.150 align:start position:0%
but how do i know how to divide that between like the the compute and the i o

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.230 align:start position:0%
well like it's

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
well like it's it's the same in you know like like i

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
it's the same in you know like like i said like it it doesn't that question is

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.829 align:start position:0%
said like it it doesn't that question is not

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:26.470 align:start position:0%
not a question around multi-dimension versus

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
a question around multi-dimension versus single dimension

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.630 align:start position:0%
single dimension because that that like if you want to

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.150 align:start position:0%
because that that like if you want to multi like if you want to say like i

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
multi like if you want to say like i want to pay 10 percent more

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
for

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.950 align:start position:0%
for on top of the market rate right for

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.510 align:start position:0%
on top of the market rate right for storage let's say

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.710 align:start position:0%
storage let's say because that's where there is contention

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.710 align:start position:0%
because that's where there is contention you have to know that

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.309 align:start position:0%
you have to know that that's exactly what you you have to have

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:52.150 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what you you have to have like you have to have the uh yeah market

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.109 align:start position:0%
like you have to have the uh yeah market price for for storage

00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:57.589 align:start position:0%
price for for storage if you just layer like 10 flat on

00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:59.670 align:start position:0%
if you just layer like 10 flat on everything

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.710 align:start position:0%
everything uh you're just going to above overbid

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
which is maybe okay right like for some

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.270 align:start position:0%
which is maybe okay right like for some people if the fees are relatively low

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.630 align:start position:0%
people if the fees are relatively low you know what's the difference between

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.230 align:start position:0%
you know what's the difference between you know

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.589 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know half a lumen and

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.109 align:start position:0%
uh you know half a lumen and two-thirds of aluminum or something i

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:23.829 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of aluminum or something i don't know

00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:25.829 align:start position:0%
like historically we've seen that uh

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:28.470 align:start position:0%
like historically we've seen that uh like in some situations people are

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.829 align:start position:0%
like in some situations people are getting uh are bidding very high on

00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
getting uh are bidding very high on on certain uh

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:40.710 align:start position:0%
on certain uh for certain patterns

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:45.109 align:start position:0%
um it would be great to maybe um and

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.790 align:start position:0%
um it would be great to maybe um and forgive me if it's already in the cap

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.190 align:start position:0%
forgive me if it's already in the cap but just like understanding what is the

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
but just like understanding what is the like the

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.589 align:start position:0%
like the uh what's the expected wallet strategy

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:55.589 align:start position:0%
uh what's the expected wallet strategy or client strategy here

00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
or client strategy here uh when uh like in terms of user

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.510 align:start position:0%
uh when uh like in terms of user experience like what do they present to

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
experience like what do they present to the user

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
the user and what uh you know what kind of inputs

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
and what uh you know what kind of inputs do they expect from the users

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:14.069 align:start position:0%
yeah sure

00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.990 align:start position:0%
okay let's talk about state exploration

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.349 align:start position:0%
okay let's talk about state exploration nico

00:43:17.359 --> 00:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
nico where is it well so state exploration

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.950 align:start position:0%
where is it well so state exploration yeah goes kind of hand to hand with the

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
yeah goes kind of hand to hand with the uh model that i have there for storing

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.470 align:start position:0%
uh model that i have there for storing data on the ledger so like the in the

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.309 align:start position:0%
data on the ledger so like the in the proposal it's basically like there are

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:32.150 align:start position:0%
proposal it's basically like there are two parts to it there's the how do you

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.430 align:start position:0%
two parts to it there's the how do you model

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
model a write

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.109 align:start position:0%
a write and uh as in

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:39.430 align:start position:0%
and uh as in and so writers can be a

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.790 align:start position:0%
and so writers can be a create a ledger entry or an update

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
create a ledger entry or an update um and how does it work um

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.150 align:start position:0%
um and how does it work um like how do we have like the

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
like how do we have like the the right price basically for the cost

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
the right price basically for the cost of storage

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
of storage um

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.990 align:start position:0%
um so in the proposal what i what i did is

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.109 align:start position:0%
so in the proposal what i what i did is uh

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:02.870 align:start position:0%
uh i basically used as an approximation for

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.870 align:start position:0%
i basically used as an approximation for um

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.190 align:start position:0%
um for the cluster storage the

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.750 align:start position:0%
for the cluster storage the bucket list size so like the

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.630 align:start position:0%
bucket list size so like the uh

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh some basically like the

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.589 align:start position:0%
some basically like the the ledger is organized into those uh

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
the ledger is organized into those uh like uh 19 buckets

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.349 align:start position:0%
like uh 19 buckets i think it's 19 uh and then uh

00:44:21.359 --> 00:44:24.230 align:start position:0%
i think it's 19 uh and then uh um it you if you

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.510 align:start position:0%
um it you if you if you

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
if you do a um

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
do a um an update

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
an update or a create you basically append that to

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.950 align:start position:0%
or a create you basically append that to the

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
the to the very first bucket in the bucket

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
to the very first bucket in the bucket list

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
list so that's how

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.150 align:start position:0%
so that's how um basically like based on the

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
um basically like based on the size of the the the total size the or

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.109 align:start position:0%
size of the the the total size the or total size of the ledger

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:49.190 align:start position:0%
total size of the ledger um

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.990 align:start position:0%
um um i allocate like a a price function uh

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.910 align:start position:0%
um i allocate like a a price function uh that kind of looks like an exponential

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
that kind of looks like an exponential from fall uh like basically it starts

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.470 align:start position:0%
from fall uh like basically it starts with a slow slope

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.589 align:start position:0%
with a slow slope up to uh

00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
up to uh some number let's say you say oh like

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.630 align:start position:0%
some number let's say you say oh like validators here kind of determining

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.470 align:start position:0%
validators here kind of determining those parameters but like you can think

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.190 align:start position:0%
those parameters but like you can think of it as the leaders say oh yeah right

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.109 align:start position:0%
of it as the leaders say oh yeah right now we are running on

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:13.829 align:start position:0%
now we are running on drives with uh i don't know like uh

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
drives with uh i don't know like uh 25

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.750 align:start position:0%
25 gigs or 50 gigs of space right um and

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
gigs or 50 gigs of space right um and they're going to basically set

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.349 align:start position:0%
they're going to basically set parameters such that

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
parameters such that um

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.550 align:start position:0%
um they don't have to

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.829 align:start position:0%
they don't have to um

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.349 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
kind of uh buy new drives uh you know like if

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.190 align:start position:0%
buy new drives uh you know like if there's too much traffic

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
there's too much traffic so

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
so so the price function is basically looks

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.790 align:start position:0%
so the price function is basically looks in this case like you have like your

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
in this case like you have like your normal slope that goes to

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
normal slope that goes to in like i don't know let's say you have

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.109 align:start position:0%
in like i don't know let's say you have 100 gig and it would be like

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:47.670 align:start position:0%
100 gig and it would be like i want to use maybe like the first 80

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.990 align:start position:0%
i want to use maybe like the first 80 gig at a

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
gig at a rate um

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
rate um that's going to be

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.069 align:start position:0%
that's going to be uh

00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:56.950 align:start position:0%
uh like a good rate but not

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
like a good rate but not not like overly aggressive

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.230 align:start position:0%
not like overly aggressive and then the last 20 gigs i want to

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.910 align:start position:0%
and then the last 20 gigs i want to really slow down uh like the the growth

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
really slow down uh like the the growth so that's right like from 5 looks like

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.430 align:start position:0%
so that's right like from 5 looks like this hockey stick type of shape right

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.870 align:start position:0%
this hockey stick type of shape right like an exponential

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.470 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.390 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the model for pricing

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.069 align:start position:0%
the model for pricing growing the bucket list

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:21.349 align:start position:0%
growing the bucket list so

00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
so you have that uh for that's four rights

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.990 align:start position:0%
you have that uh for that's four rights then the problem is that this is only

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.349 align:start position:0%
then the problem is that this is only like uh this is like um saying okay you

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:33.190 align:start position:0%
like uh this is like um saying okay you can add to the bucket list but then uh

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.069 align:start position:0%
can add to the bucket list but then uh like

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:35.670 align:start position:0%
like and and by the way like if you delete

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
and and by the way like if you delete entries

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.950 align:start position:0%
entries um

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
um eventually those get collapsed into the

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.230 align:start position:0%
eventually those get collapsed into the buckets and so the bucket is uh shrinks

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.630 align:start position:0%
buckets and so the bucket is uh shrinks uh in that model a delete you still pay

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.670 align:start position:0%
uh in that model a delete you still pay for or delete actually um because delete

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.230 align:start position:0%
for or delete actually um because delete is actually adding a little bit of

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
is actually adding a little bit of of data to the bucket list

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
of data to the bucket list uh so that's like first thing to note

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh so that's like first thing to note here uh

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.349 align:start position:0%
here uh um and then uh yeah what i wanted to get

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:05.030 align:start position:0%
um and then uh yeah what i wanted to get here is uh

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.030 align:start position:0%
here is uh as a kind of

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.910 align:start position:0%
as a kind of more like a desired property is that i

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:13.190 align:start position:0%
more like a desired property is that i want the price of storage for people to

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.190 align:start position:0%
want the price of storage for people to to kind of be the same for everybody

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.510 align:start position:0%
to kind of be the same for everybody regardless if they

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.150 align:start position:0%
regardless if they signed up for you know uh created an

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
signed up for you know uh created an account uh like

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.790 align:start position:0%
account uh like two years ago or you know in five years

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.589 align:start position:0%
two years ago or you know in five years uh

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
uh it should be

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
it should be uh over time same cost

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh over time same cost and um there should be no way to do like

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.910 align:start position:0%
and um there should be no way to do like uh to have like a free ride on the on on

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.829 align:start position:0%
uh to have like a free ride on the on on the on the ledger right like so you

00:47:37.839 --> 00:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
the on the ledger right like so you shouldn't be able to have like

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.710 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to have like store

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.829 align:start position:0%
store i don't know like

00:47:41.839 --> 00:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
i don't know like nfts like jpegs whatever

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.470 align:start position:0%
nfts like jpegs whatever on chain uh you pay

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.270 align:start position:0%
on chain uh you pay for for this when uh storage is cheap

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.150 align:start position:0%
for for this when uh storage is cheap and then uh now you have like uh

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
and then uh now you have like uh something that is cheaper than uh

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
something that is cheaper than uh than even storing in aws right like that

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
than even storing in aws right like that that doesn't make any sense

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.750 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense um so this

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.430 align:start position:0%
um so this in with that said

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.670 align:start position:0%
in with that said there's then a need for having some way

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.829 align:start position:0%
there's then a need for having some way of

00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:11.190 align:start position:0%
of kind of uh resetting in a way uh the

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.309 align:start position:0%
kind of uh resetting in a way uh the the

00:48:12.319 --> 00:48:15.990 align:start position:0%
the the price of uh of storage over time

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
the price of uh of storage over time and uh the mechanism that i use there is

00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
and uh the mechanism that i use there is state expiration

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
state expiration so state expiration here means that

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.349 align:start position:0%
so state expiration here means that you have to

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:29.970 align:start position:0%
basically

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
basically [Music]

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.390 align:start position:0%
[Music] pay for

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.950 align:start position:0%
pay for market market price of storage

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.910 align:start position:0%
market market price of storage uh

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.670 align:start position:0%
uh to maintain a ledger entry on on the

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
to maintain a ledger entry on on the like a live in the in the ledger

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.950 align:start position:0%
like a live in the in the ledger if you do not pay for this uh

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.349 align:start position:0%
if you do not pay for this uh for those uh

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.790 align:start position:0%
for those uh for this

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.190 align:start position:0%
for this for your brands basically

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.270 align:start position:0%
for your brands basically you get uh perched that's kind of the

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.549 align:start position:0%
you get uh perched that's kind of the the choice that i made in this cap

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.710 align:start position:0%
the choice that i made in this cap there are a bunch of other ways uh that

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.630 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of other ways uh that can be done uh that are actually

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.549 align:start position:0%
can be done uh that are actually mentioned in the recap in the other

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the recap in the other approaches

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
approaches um but like the

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:11.430 align:start position:0%
um but like the the

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.829 align:start position:0%
the reason this kind of works with the other

00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:16.390 align:start position:0%
reason this kind of works with the other mechanism is that basically like if you

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
mechanism is that basically like if you if you set a policy for example by

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
if you set a policy for example by default you have to

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.510 align:start position:0%
default you have to pay rent like a refresh every year let's

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.190 align:start position:0%
pay rent like a refresh every year let's say

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.549 align:start position:0%
say uh

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:27.910 align:start position:0%
uh and then

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.470 align:start position:0%
and then you don't pay your your

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.109 align:start position:0%
you don't pay your your your renewal after a year

00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:38.309 align:start position:0%
your renewal after a year uh yeah your the data gets uh deleted

00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.589 align:start position:0%
uh yeah your the data gets uh deleted um

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
um and yeah so there's this kind of

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.349 align:start position:0%
and yeah so there's this kind of constant churn i guess on the ledger

00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:46.630 align:start position:0%
constant churn i guess on the ledger which is kind of a new pattern

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.349 align:start position:0%
which is kind of a new pattern and

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:52.710 align:start position:0%
that construction is basically a way to

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.950 align:start position:0%
that construction is basically a way to to guarantee that everybody

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.790 align:start position:0%
to guarantee that everybody in the last year has

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
in the last year has has been paying basically something

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
has been paying basically something that is

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:08.309 align:start position:0%
that is market rate

00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.630 align:start position:0%
how long do you expect the

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.630 align:start position:0%
how long do you expect the like the how far in the f like when i

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.549 align:start position:0%
like the how far in the f like when i trade a letter entry

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:16.790 align:start position:0%
trade a letter entry how far is the maximum expiration date

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.390 align:start position:0%
how far is the maximum expiration date that i can choose or that will get

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.990 align:start position:0%
that i can choose or that will get chosen for me in the future this stuff

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.190 align:start position:0%
chosen for me in the future this stuff isn't as far as i can tell it's not

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.190 align:start position:0%
isn't as far as i can tell it's not specified in the cap how that works so

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.510 align:start position:0%
specified in the cap how that works so right so so right now the cap what it

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.670 align:start position:0%
right so so right now the cap what it says is that it do not

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.230 align:start position:0%
says is that it do not so you can renew indefinitely right uh

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.230 align:start position:0%
so you can renew indefinitely right uh like the the renewal

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.109 align:start position:0%
like the the renewal window is determined by validators

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:37.670 align:start position:0%
window is determined by validators so that's why i said it's like a

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.670 align:start position:0%
so that's why i said it's like a um

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.589 align:start position:0%
um like you say every year you have to pay

00:50:41.599 --> 00:50:43.270 align:start position:0%
like you say every year you have to pay run

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
run right and then every time you write you

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.510 align:start position:0%
right and then every time you write you do an append

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:52.829 align:start position:0%
do an append that happen is valid uh for a

00:50:52.839 --> 00:51:00.230 align:start position:0%
year right that's good that's demo then

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.670 align:start position:0%
isn't there a natural trade-off between

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.349 align:start position:0%
isn't there a natural trade-off between like renewal time and um like

00:51:03.359 --> 00:51:05.670 align:start position:0%
like renewal time and um like fluctuations in this price of storage or

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in this price of storage or are we expecting like this storage cost

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
are we expecting like this storage cost to not um

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.630 align:start position:0%
to not um increase too quickly

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.870 align:start position:0%
well it depends uh like what we've seen

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.950 align:start position:0%
well it depends uh like what we've seen on the on the current network is uh

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.950 align:start position:0%
on the on the current network is uh ledger size has been increasing actually

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.190 align:start position:0%
ledger size has been increasing actually rapidly over the last uh few months

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.630 align:start position:0%
rapidly over the last uh few months because of

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.230 align:start position:0%
because of like some

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
like some strange token activity

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.549 align:start position:0%
strange token activity which is not entirely uh i mean it's

00:51:32.559 --> 00:51:34.630 align:start position:0%
which is not entirely uh i mean it's it's not

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
it's not i mean there are a combination of

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.069 align:start position:0%
i mean there are a combination of factors like uh

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:40.630 align:start position:0%
factors like uh one is uh yeah like just price of in

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.109 align:start position:0%
one is uh yeah like just price of in crypto assets go you know uh

00:51:43.119 --> 00:51:45.510 align:start position:0%
crypto assets go you know uh going down uh but also like when they

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.390 align:start position:0%
going down uh but also like when they were

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.790 align:start position:0%
were still

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.829 align:start position:0%
pretty high you had like an incentive to

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:54.710 align:start position:0%
pretty high you had like an incentive to to create more crypto assets so it

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.309 align:start position:0%
to create more crypto assets so it basically those things kind of cancel

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:58.950 align:start position:0%
basically those things kind of cancel each other and the growth has been uh

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.710 align:start position:0%
each other and the growth has been uh pretty significant

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
pretty significant so i would say like

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.549 align:start position:0%
so i would say like uh seeing a growth rate

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:08.710 align:start position:0%
uh seeing a growth rate um

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.670 align:start position:0%
um that

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.030 align:start position:0%
that takes you to

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.710 align:start position:0%
takes you to uh yeah something that will be

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.950 align:start position:0%
uh yeah something that will be you want the market basically to kind of

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.870 align:start position:0%
you want the market basically to kind of get to an eco equilibrium right like

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
get to an eco equilibrium right like where

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.309 align:start position:0%
where uh

00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:25.349 align:start position:0%
uh where like uh

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:29.430 align:start position:0%
you do not have like uh like those weird

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.349 align:start position:0%
you do not have like uh like those weird use cases uh

00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:33.109 align:start position:0%
use cases uh appearing on the network if they if they

00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:34.150 align:start position:0%
appearing on the network if they if they are like

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.069 align:start position:0%
are like cheaper than

00:52:36.079 --> 00:52:37.589 align:start position:0%
cheaper than right now i think on on the on the

00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:39.670 align:start position:0%
right now i think on on the on the network the the the problem we have is

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.510 align:start position:0%
network the the the problem we have is uh yeah we are cheaper than

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we are cheaper than aws fault in some situations

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.549 align:start position:0%
isn't there a trade-off here between

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
isn't there a trade-off here between not necessarily a trade-off but isn't

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.030 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a trade-off but isn't there a consequence here that people

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.549 align:start position:0%
there a consequence here that people will have to go and touch their data

00:52:56.559 --> 00:52:58.790 align:start position:0%
will have to go and touch their data from time to time and

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.109 align:start position:0%
from time to time and people are procrastinators and like

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:02.710 align:start position:0%
people are procrastinators and like let's say that like

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
let's say that like the expiration date is you know when

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.069 align:start position:0%
the expiration date is you know when you're in the future or something

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
you're in the future or something uh

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh everybody at the end of that year then

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.950 align:start position:0%
everybody at the end of that year then has to go and touch all their data and

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.790 align:start position:0%
has to go and touch all their data and there's gonna be a huge log jam to get

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.710 align:start position:0%
there's gonna be a huge log jam to get it done

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
it done well that's there would be a large jump

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
well that's there would be a large jump if everybody creates their stuff at the

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
if everybody creates their stuff at the same time but you would that's not the

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.270 align:start position:0%
same time but you would that's not the case it's going to be

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.630 align:start position:0%
case it's going to be you know like basically like the thing

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.870 align:start position:0%
you know like basically like the thing that expires in a year is the whatever

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
that expires in a year is the whatever happened today right like

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.270 align:start position:0%
happened today right like at the given date

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.510 align:start position:0%
at the given date right but i mean like imagine that today

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.549 align:start position:0%
right but i mean like imagine that today you have a day with like a lot of

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:35.670 align:start position:0%
you have a day with like a lot of activity like you can look back

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.109 align:start position:0%
activity like you can look back historically of stellar's history and

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:38.150 align:start position:0%
historically of stellar's history and there are periods when there were like

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
there are periods when there were like lots of token creations and stuff you

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.710 align:start position:0%
lots of token creations and stuff you know there are days when there's

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
know there are days when there's hundreds of thousands of blood draw

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.030 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of blood draw entries

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.549 align:start position:0%
entries created

00:53:44.559 --> 00:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
created um

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
um and then abundant

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.829 align:start position:0%
and then abundant well many of them are abandoned but like

00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
well many of them are abandoned but like you could imagine a world where they're

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
you could imagine a world where they're not all abandoned right and then what

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.069 align:start position:0%
not all abandoned right and then what happens a year in the future

00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:57.510 align:start position:0%
happens a year in the future well nothing well people are

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.710 align:start position:0%
well nothing well people are incentivized to come back some time

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.549 align:start position:0%
incentivized to come back some time between here and then i i don't i don't

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
between here and then i i don't i don't see this as

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.430 align:start position:0%
see this as any worse than the fact that we have to

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.349 align:start position:0%
any worse than the fact that we have to handle load spikes in general yeah i

00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
handle load spikes in general yeah i mean we have to handle load spikes and

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
mean we have to handle load spikes and let's bikes may get

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.549 align:start position:0%
let's bikes may get replicated but

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:12.390 align:start position:0%
replicated but yeah like what um

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.549 align:start position:0%
yeah like what um so what i sketched uh or what we

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
so what i sketched uh or what we sketched actually in the cup which is uh

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.670 align:start position:0%
sketched actually in the cup which is uh you know just a more of a strowman type

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.190 align:start position:0%
you know just a more of a strowman type of thing because i'm sure we can do

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
of thing because i'm sure we can do better than that is uh

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
better than that is uh is we actually are um kind of uh

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.910 align:start position:0%
is we actually are um kind of uh ensuring that uh you do not have like

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.230 align:start position:0%
ensuring that uh you do not have like giant spikes so like uh it like i think

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.150 align:start position:0%
giant spikes so like uh it like i think the spike would be not be because of

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.150 align:start position:0%
the spike would be not be because of situations don't like what you're

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.589 align:start position:0%
situations don't like what you're what you mentioned because actually

00:54:39.599 --> 00:54:41.670 align:start position:0%
what you mentioned because actually activity from today

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.950 align:start position:0%
activity from today uh

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.190 align:start position:0%
uh if you have like a comp a a

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.870 align:start position:0%
if you have like a comp a a a um

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.549 align:start position:0%
a um a linear like a translation right like

00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:50.470 align:start position:0%
a linear like a translation right like an actual just

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.630 align:start position:0%
an actual just shapes right like all this activity gets

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.589 align:start position:0%
shapes right like all this activity gets translated exactly a year from now i you

00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:57.990 align:start position:0%
translated exactly a year from now i you don't have a problem i think the

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.910 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem i think the it's just like additional

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
it's just like additional uh cost of running a validator right

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh cost of running a validator right like it's uh let's you say okay i need

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.430 align:start position:0%
like it's uh let's you say okay i need to

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.349 align:start position:0%
to when i set my limits right the number of

00:55:07.359 --> 00:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
when i set my limits right the number of rights

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.789 align:start position:0%
rights i actually have to think about well

00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
i actually have to think about well actually my capacity in rights is half

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.829 align:start position:0%
actually my capacity in rights is half of of what i can

00:55:15.839 --> 00:55:17.750 align:start position:0%
of of what i can add to the ledger because i also need to

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.190 align:start position:0%
add to the ledger because i also need to delete right

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:27.349 align:start position:0%
delete right but what can happen is uh more of a

00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:29.270 align:start position:0%
like

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.470 align:start position:0%
like um

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.390 align:start position:0%
um if we have different expiration times

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.069 align:start position:0%
if we have different expiration times which i actually

00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.109 align:start position:0%
which i actually kind of

00:55:35.119 --> 00:55:37.109 align:start position:0%
kind of briefly talked about there

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:38.870 align:start position:0%
briefly talked about there is that if you have different expiration

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.829 align:start position:0%
is that if you have different expiration times

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:42.549 align:start position:0%
times you can have actually different dates

00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:43.589 align:start position:0%
you can have actually different dates that

00:55:43.599 --> 00:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
that end up expiring

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.829 align:start position:0%
end up expiring at the same

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:50.230 align:start position:0%
at the same date and uh and that's for that for

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
date and uh and that's for that for those type of situations you have to

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
those type of situations you have to have an algorithm that kind of uh

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.270 align:start position:0%
have an algorithm that kind of uh smooths things out and that doesn't

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.150 align:start position:0%
smooths things out and that doesn't actually cause the system to

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.230 align:start position:0%
actually cause the system to kind of create a gigantic spike you know

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.150 align:start position:0%
kind of create a gigantic spike you know at a specific dates

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
so just we don't have a lot of time but

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.470 align:start position:0%
so just we don't have a lot of time but i just want to ask uh what like the

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.990 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask uh what like the biggest question i think that there is

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.549 align:start position:0%
biggest question i think that there is like what is the what's the expected

00:56:12.559 --> 00:56:15.030 align:start position:0%
like what is the what's the expected behavior here like you know these ledger

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.309 align:start position:0%
behavior here like you know these ledger entries are representing financial

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:17.589 align:start position:0%
entries are representing financial instruments

00:56:17.599 --> 00:56:20.309 align:start position:0%
instruments um let's say assets just for simplicity

00:56:20.319 --> 00:56:21.589 align:start position:0%
um let's say assets just for simplicity even though we have like a standard

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:24.150 align:start position:0%
even though we have like a standard asset contract

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.910 align:start position:0%
asset contract and i'm

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.109 align:start position:0%
and i'm uh you know paddling on

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:31.270 align:start position:0%
uh you know paddling on shares of something

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.309 align:start position:0%
shares of something um

00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:34.870 align:start position:0%
um is what is the expectations

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.390 align:start position:0%
is what is the expectations or what is what's expectations there's

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
or what is what's expectations there's like am i supposed to like once a year

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.710 align:start position:0%
like am i supposed to like once a year like come and touch this

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.870 align:start position:0%
like come and touch this is like the operator

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
is like the operator of this financial instrument supposed to

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.309 align:start position:0%
of this financial instrument supposed to do that for me

00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:47.990 align:start position:0%
do that for me um if

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
um if you know if you look at uh

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.510 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at uh you know various common immutable

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.150 align:start position:0%
you know various common immutable contracts like uni swap you know and so

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.829 align:start position:0%
contracts like uni swap you know and so and and i'm holding on like these uni

00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:57.750 align:start position:0%
and and i'm holding on like these uni tokens

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.190 align:start position:0%
tokens what's the expectation here like who's

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.190 align:start position:0%
what's the expectation here like who's going to touch these for me

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
going to touch these for me right so in the in the

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
right so in the in the in the cap i i actually let this kind of

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.190 align:start position:0%
in the cap i i actually let this kind of flexible like uh there's a

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.870 align:start position:0%
flexible like uh there's a when you there's actually a special host

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.190 align:start position:0%
when you there's actually a special host function to that you can call that is

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.630 align:start position:0%
function to that you can call that is basically a

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.349 align:start position:0%
basically a rewrite equivalent to like a rewrite uh

00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:23.670 align:start position:0%
rewrite equivalent to like a rewrite uh ledger entry um so that you refresh the

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.950 align:start position:0%
ledger entry um so that you refresh the that that expiration time

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
that that expiration time anybody can do that all right like

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.910 align:start position:0%
anybody can do that all right like there's no

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
there's no it's not i understand that anyone can do

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
it's not i understand that anyone can do that but who is who do you expect to do

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
that but who is who do you expect to do that

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.710 align:start position:0%
that well it depends on the type of users

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.549 align:start position:0%
well it depends on the type of users right like uh like power users probably

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:41.030 align:start position:0%
right like uh like power users probably don't want to do it themselves uh like

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.950 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it themselves uh like other situations you know if you're if

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.789 align:start position:0%
other situations you know if you're if you're like you said like this very

00:57:44.799 --> 00:57:46.950 align:start position:0%
you're like you said like this very passive type of person uh maybe you

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.630 align:start position:0%
passive type of person uh maybe you should pay somebody to maintain your

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.190 align:start position:0%
should pay somebody to maintain your stuff if that's what you really want

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.789 align:start position:0%
stuff if that's what you really want uh in other situations i suspect uh

00:57:54.799 --> 00:57:57.109 align:start position:0%
uh in other situations i suspect uh if people are not active they probably

00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:59.829 align:start position:0%
if people are not active they probably should just be using centralized uh

00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:01.349 align:start position:0%
should just be using centralized uh infrastructure

00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
infrastructure like you know contracts or whatever that

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.630 align:start position:0%
like you know contracts or whatever that are a little more

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.910 align:start position:0%
are a little more centralized

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.750 align:start position:0%
centralized i think trump's point is that there's a

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.670 align:start position:0%
i think trump's point is that there's a free rider problem here like imagine

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.109 align:start position:0%
free rider problem here like imagine that all the people in this room are

00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:14.470 align:start position:0%
that all the people in this room are using a single contract right

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.750 align:start position:0%
using a single contract right like

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.069 align:start position:0%
like which one of us can touch me all of us

00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:20.069 align:start position:0%
which one of us can touch me all of us have an incentive to wait until the last

00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:21.990 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to wait until the last second and play chicken and hope that

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.829 align:start position:0%
second and play chicken and hope that somebody else oh like yeah for a short

00:58:23.839 --> 00:58:26.069 align:start position:0%
somebody else oh like yeah for a short contract i think that uh

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:28.710 align:start position:0%
contract i think that uh yeah well it's if it's a shared goodness

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.190 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's if it's a shared goodness uh

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh like uh

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.750 align:start position:0%
like uh just

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.549 align:start position:0%
just i

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:36.309 align:start position:0%
i that's not what actually what i asked

00:58:36.319 --> 00:58:38.150 align:start position:0%
that's not what actually what i asked john i assumed that

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.230 align:start position:0%
john i assumed that uh like each of us will have like our

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.829 align:start position:0%
uh like each of us will have like our own ledger entry

00:58:41.839 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
own ledger entry within that contract

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.390 align:start position:0%
within that contract so maybe did i not understand correctly

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
so maybe did i not understand correctly i think i think i'm concerned about

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.829 align:start position:0%
i think i think i'm concerned about people's money vanishing into thin air

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:51.589 align:start position:0%
people's money vanishing into thin air which is completely reasonable these are

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:53.589 align:start position:0%
which is completely reasonable these are balances and we're just going to delete

00:58:53.599 --> 00:58:59.349 align:start position:0%
balances and we're just going to delete them that's not that's not super great

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:01.270 align:start position:0%
i recall there being a proposal to like

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.950 align:start position:0%
i recall there being a proposal to like uh have um

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.710 align:start position:0%
uh have um but what happened to this um like when

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
but what happened to this um like when you have a ledger engine deleted it like

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.309 align:start position:0%
you have a ledger engine deleted it like gets um

00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:10.390 align:start position:0%
gets um dumped into like some kind of merkle try

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.309 align:start position:0%
dumped into like some kind of merkle try and you store the hat root of that try

00:59:12.319 --> 00:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
and you store the hat root of that try and then like when i want to bring it

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.589 align:start position:0%
and then like when i want to bring it back i can like bring in a proof that

00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
back i can like bring in a proof that this is what the state was right so this

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.150 align:start position:0%
this is what the state was right so this is actually in the appendix yeah the

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.390 align:start position:0%
is actually in the appendix yeah the alternative section so this there is

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.390 align:start position:0%
alternative section so this there is actually a very detailed uh

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.750 align:start position:0%
actually a very detailed uh proposal in ethereum foreign v2

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.309 align:start position:0%
proposal in ethereum foreign v2 uh about

00:59:29.319 --> 00:59:31.990 align:start position:0%
uh about this um

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
this um so the complications from

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.870 align:start position:0%
so the complications from this archive approach is uh

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.069 align:start position:0%
this archive approach is uh is when you uh want to

00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:44.150 align:start position:0%
is when you uh want to so like uh restoring is actually yeah

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.750 align:start position:0%
so like uh restoring is actually yeah like a trivial like i said like you know

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.309 align:start position:0%
like a trivial like i said like you know you have like a maybe a way to do like a

00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:51.030 align:start position:0%
you have like a maybe a way to do like a to just to basically store that that

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
to just to basically store that that entry in in inside a

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.230 align:start position:0%
entry in in inside a merkle tri of source right um and then

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.670 align:start position:0%
merkle tri of source right um and then you just need to provide the proof for

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
you just need to provide the proof for that

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.349 align:start position:0%
that uh the complexity comes from

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:04.630 align:start position:0%
uh the complexity comes from uh when you want to create an entry

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.870 align:start position:0%
uh when you want to create an entry because you have to prove that that

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.270 align:start position:0%
because you have to prove that that entry doesn't exist in historical data

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
entry doesn't exist in historical data like that was actually archived

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
like that was actually archived and that gets really nasty

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.069 align:start position:0%
and that gets really nasty very fast right right sure

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
but like that that like not wanting to

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.230 align:start position:0%
but like that that like not wanting to do that doesn't address creating this

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.190 align:start position:0%
do that doesn't address creating this question like

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.309 align:start position:0%
question like what do you do if your money gets

01:00:24.319 --> 01:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
what do you do if your money gets deleted

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.829 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's an event like uh like

01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:32.069 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's an event like uh like you know if it's a

01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:34.230 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a uh like with an issue it's like today if

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
uh like with an issue it's like today if you're on the seller network if you're

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.349 align:start position:0%
you're on the seller network if you're sending back to the issuer you know you

01:00:37.359 --> 01:00:38.630 align:start position:0%
sending back to the issuer you know you basically

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.789 align:start position:0%
basically burn it you can ask the issuer like hey

01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:43.829 align:start position:0%
burn it you can ask the issuer like hey sorry i didn't mean to do that but

01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't mean to do that but but i didn't burn it

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.710 align:start position:0%
but i didn't burn it but like what if you're like

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.309 align:start position:0%
but like what if you're like what if it's not like you know an

01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
what if it's not like you know an off-chain issuer that you can appeal to

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.230 align:start position:0%
off-chain issuer that you can appeal to like what if your unit swap lp tokens

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
like what if your unit swap lp tokens get get deleted what do you do

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.510 align:start position:0%
it's tough yeah uh like uh you know

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
it's tough yeah uh like uh you know these those are the rules of the network

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.470 align:start position:0%
these those are the rules of the network wait but that's not

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.829 align:start position:0%
wait but that's not that's not a great solution long term

01:01:07.839 --> 01:01:09.109 align:start position:0%
that's not a great solution long term right like we're gonna have a lot of

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:11.190 align:start position:0%
right like we're gonna have a lot of people

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
people consider the alternative right which is

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.030 align:start position:0%
consider the alternative right which is infinite growth of a ledger

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.270 align:start position:0%
infinite growth of a ledger with infinite price which one do you

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
with infinite price which one do you prefer i mean like

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
prefer i mean like objectively like

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.910 align:start position:0%
objectively like if somebody had a million dollars of

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.589 align:start position:0%
if somebody had a million dollars of like uniform lp shares get liquidated

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:30.789 align:start position:0%
like uniform lp shares get liquidated it would have been better to pay for a

01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:33.270 align:start position:0%
it would have been better to pay for a million dollars of storage

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.829 align:start position:0%
million dollars of storage so that one person yes but like uh what

01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:38.309 align:start position:0%
so that one person yes but like uh what about everybody else

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:39.829 align:start position:0%
about everybody else and that person with a million dollars

01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:41.829 align:start position:0%
and that person with a million dollars like if they have that it's kind of like

01:01:41.839 --> 01:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
like if they have that it's kind of like key management like you you have

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.190 align:start position:0%
key management like you you have procedures to make sure that

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.589 align:start position:0%
procedures to make sure that you don't lose your million dollars it

01:01:49.599 --> 01:01:50.950 align:start position:0%
you don't lose your million dollars it is it is currently the case that people

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.950 align:start position:0%
is it is currently the case that people with million dollar balances can in fact

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
with million dollar balances can in fact uh lose them because they can lose their

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.069 align:start position:0%
uh lose them because they can lose their keys so there's there is there is

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
keys so there's there is there is something to appeal to here like it is

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.950 align:start position:0%
something to appeal to here like it is it is actually possible for you to lose

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.230 align:start position:0%
it is actually possible for you to lose money just by

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.150 align:start position:0%
money just by misusing the system but

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.670 align:start position:0%
misusing the system but what about the other end of the spectrum

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
what about the other end of the spectrum though somebody who doesn't have a

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.789 align:start position:0%
though somebody who doesn't have a million dollars they have a small amount

01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:08.870 align:start position:0%
million dollars they have a small amount of their balance and they're just

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.549 align:start position:0%
of their balance and they're just constantly eating that up by paying

01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
constantly eating that up by paying these fees

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.829 align:start position:0%
these fees to keep their balance alive i mean it

01:02:13.839 --> 01:02:15.829 align:start position:0%
to keep their balance alive i mean it sort of reminds me of like bank accounts

01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:17.270 align:start position:0%
sort of reminds me of like bank accounts where you're like bank accounts just

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.470 align:start position:0%
where you're like bank accounts just disappearing because you're paying all

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.630 align:start position:0%
disappearing because you're paying all these fees

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.390 align:start position:0%
yeah they do eventually disappear if you

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.430 align:start position:0%
yeah they do eventually disappear if you if you put five dollars in a bank

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.950 align:start position:0%
if you put five dollars in a bank account and then wait for 20 years it'll

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.670 align:start position:0%
account and then wait for 20 years it'll go away

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
i mean this just points to yeah you're

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.990 align:start position:0%
i mean this just points to yeah you're not stirring your your balance in the

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.430 align:start position:0%
not stirring your your balance in the right place

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.630 align:start position:0%
right place like this is shared infrastructure like

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.230 align:start position:0%
like this is shared infrastructure like if you don't if you don't use it you

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.589 align:start position:0%
if you don't if you don't use it you lose it

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:44.230 align:start position:0%
lose it but nikki you can't just like ignore the

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.430 align:start position:0%
but nikki you can't just like ignore the entire

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.230 align:start position:0%
entire industry that we're in and you know i'm

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
industry that we're in and you know i'm not pretending that this is not a

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.349 align:start position:0%
not pretending that this is not a problem like people are overlooking this

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:52.549 align:start position:0%
problem like people are overlooking this problem

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:53.430 align:start position:0%
problem but

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
but um you know it's

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
um you know it's i think it will be really difficult to

01:02:57.119 --> 01:02:58.870 align:start position:0%
i think it will be really difficult to bring people into stellar

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.710 align:start position:0%
bring people into stellar telling them oh this is the way it works

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.190 align:start position:0%
telling them oh this is the way it works in selena right so

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.309 align:start position:0%
in selena right so it's a fader no it's not selena doesn't

01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's a fader no it's not selena doesn't actually

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.109 align:start position:0%
actually do any of this right now they have rant

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
do any of this right now they have rant no they don't they literally don't

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
no they don't they literally don't charge it right now it's a to be done in

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.349 align:start position:0%
charge it right now it's a to be done in the future feature that no one wants so

01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:18.230 align:start position:0%
the future feature that no one wants so they're never actually going to get

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
they're never actually going to get around to doing it

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.230 align:start position:0%
they have infinite ledger in memory

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.430 align:start position:0%
they have infinite ledger in memory they they allow they charge you money to

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.990 align:start position:0%
they they allow they charge you money to make to allocate space but they never

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.349 align:start position:0%
make to allocate space but they never actually reclaim it there's no there's

01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:35.109 align:start position:0%
actually reclaim it there's no there's no active garbage collection process

01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:36.950 align:start position:0%
so we're over time at this point and i

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
so we're over time at this point and i think that means that we have to stop i

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.510 align:start position:0%
think that means that we have to stop i mean i know that this is an interesting

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.349 align:start position:0%
mean i know that this is an interesting conversation and there's seems like

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
conversation and there's seems like there's a lot to say about

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.190 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to say about the concept of expiration

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.549 align:start position:0%
the concept of expiration um but i think

01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:48.549 align:start position:0%
um but i think we'll push it to next week's meeting and

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
we'll push it to next week's meeting and hopefully have some of this discussion

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
hopefully have some of this discussion on the stellar dev mailing list and here
