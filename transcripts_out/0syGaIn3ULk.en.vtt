Hello and welcome everyone to this week's stellar developer meeting.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.709 align:start position:0%
week's stellar developer meeting. today in the studio I have Vivo from

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
today in the studio I have Vivo from Halaps and he's going to give a super

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.430 align:start position:0%
Halaps and he's going to give a super exciting demo of the pro current

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
exciting demo of the pro current progress of the scaffold stellar. So

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.870 align:start position:0%
progress of the scaffold stellar. So please introduce yourself and yeah give

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.429 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself and yeah give us a little bit of just a small

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.029 align:start position:0%
us a little bit of just a small introduction to what is scaffold stella

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.950 align:start position:0%
introduction to what is scaffold stella to those who have not played around

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.790 align:start position:0%
to those who have not played around with it yet or haven't heard a lot about

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.870 align:start position:0%
with it yet or haven't heard a lot about it. So yeah

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
it. So yeah &gt;&gt; awesome. Yeah thanks so much Carson. So

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; awesome. Yeah thanks so much Carson. So hey guys I'm Fifo I'm work at a labs.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.869 align:start position:0%
hey guys I'm Fifo I'm work at a labs. I'm a principal engineer there and I'll

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.830 align:start position:0%
I'm a principal engineer there and I'll be presenting the scaffold stellar.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.510 align:start position:0%
be presenting the scaffold stellar. for those that don't know about it, it's

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
for those that don't know about it, it's basically it it includes a CLI and a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.310 align:start position:0%
basically it it includes a CLI and a base project in which you can start

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.029 align:start position:0%
base project in which you can start developing on stellar and sorban in a

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.350 align:start position:0%
developing on stellar and sorban in a very easy way. You can think of it as an

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.709 align:start position:0%
very easy way. You can think of it as an all-in-one repo and a lot of very

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.590 align:start position:0%
all-in-one repo and a lot of very helpful tooling around it for you to to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
helpful tooling around it for you to to build your contracts, deploy, test it,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.310 align:start position:0%
build your contracts, deploy, test it, have your own environment configuring

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.550 align:start position:0%
have your own environment configuring the way they best suit your application

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.350 align:start position:0%
the way they best suit your application and really move fast at these initial

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.990 align:start position:0%
and really move fast at these initial process and the whole the whole

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.910 align:start position:0%
process and the whole the whole development cycle. So, I'm very excited

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.990 align:start position:0%
development cycle. So, I'm very excited to share this with you guys.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.310 align:start position:0%
to share this with you guys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when when I heard about the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And when when I heard about the project for the first time, I thought

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.429 align:start position:0%
project for the first time, I thought this is a great way if you're new to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.670 align:start position:0%
this is a great way if you're new to Stellar, great way to get started. It

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
Stellar, great way to get started. It has a lot of cool plugins. But as as I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
has a lot of cool plugins. But as as I dig deeper into it, even as a more

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
dig deeper into it, even as a more experienced developer, I actually see a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
experienced developer, I actually see a lot of benefits from from using this to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.390 align:start position:0%
lot of benefits from from using this to kind of bootstrap my my application if I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.749 align:start position:0%
kind of bootstrap my my application if I want to try something new or build

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
want to try something new or build something where I don't want to spend a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.510 align:start position:0%
something where I don't want to spend a lot of time on setting up my environment

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.310 align:start position:0%
lot of time on setting up my environment and do do basic stuff. So this

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.149 align:start position:0%
and do do basic stuff. So this especially I think some of the open

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 align:start position:0%
especially I think some of the open sllin integrations are super exciting as

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.429 align:start position:0%
sllin integrations are super exciting as well. So so I the more I look into it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 align:start position:0%
well. So so I the more I look into it the more I think this this is not only

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270 align:start position:0%
the more I think this this is not only cool for new developers actually also

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
cool for new developers actually also more experienced developers who just

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.709 align:start position:0%
more experienced developers who just want to get going and build something

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
want to get going and build something without spending a lot of time on on

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.669 align:start position:0%
without spending a lot of time on on setting up their environment.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
setting up their environment. &gt;&gt; Exactly. I I think you said it all and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Exactly. I I think you said it all and it's what I think it's great about it is

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.190 align:start position:0%
it's what I think it's great about it is that it helps not just new developers

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.710 align:start position:0%
that it helps not just new developers that are coming to the ecosystem and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.390 align:start position:0%
that are coming to the ecosystem and don't really know Stellar that well. So

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.670 align:start position:0%
don't really know Stellar that well. So they might have like those common

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.750 align:start position:0%
they might have like those common initial hurdles when starting projects

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.309 align:start position:0%
initial hurdles when starting projects and and start playing around but it also

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.550 align:start position:0%
and and start playing around but it also helps like seasoned developers that know

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
helps like seasoned developers that know the ecosystem because you can really

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.670 align:start position:0%
the ecosystem because you can really customize stuff around to make like work

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
customize stuff around to make like work in the way you feel more comfortable and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.030 align:start position:0%
in the way you feel more comfortable and can really move fast and try things

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.589 align:start position:0%
can really move fast and try things really fast. So I I love it. I've been

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
really fast. So I I love it. I've been working ser for for for some time and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.790 align:start position:0%
working ser for for for some time and I've missed this kind of tool in the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.910 align:start position:0%
I've missed this kind of tool in the past.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
past. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's that's one of the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.550 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's that's one of the things that I really like about it

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.550 align:start position:0%
things that I really like about it because all of you guys who are working

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.790 align:start position:0%
because all of you guys who are working on this building this you're very you're

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
on this building this you're very you're very experienced on on the Stella

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.710 align:start position:0%
very experienced on on the Stella platform and and you make things very

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.350 align:start position:0%
platform and and you make things very customizable customizable so you can set

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
customizable customizable so you can set it up and you can customize your

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.710 align:start position:0%
it up and you can customize your settings your features what you want to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.430 align:start position:0%
settings your features what you want to include. So so it's it's nice to see

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
include. So so it's it's nice to see that more experienced developer approach

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.589 align:start position:0%
that more experienced developer approach to it as well. but you don't have to

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.190 align:start position:0%
to it as well. but you don't have to set up a lot of stuff if you just want

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.710 align:start position:0%
set up a lot of stuff if you just want to get started and want to play with it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.869 align:start position:0%
to get started and want to play with it out of the box. But but let's

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
out of the box. But but let's let's get into it and and and see what

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
let's get into it and and and see what what you guys have been working on.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
what you guys have been working on. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. Just double checking.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. Just double checking. Can you guys see my screen? Is

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.710 align:start position:0%
Can you guys see my screen? Is everything okay?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.710 align:start position:0%
everything okay? &gt;&gt; Awesome. So sometime people's

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.589 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Awesome. So sometime people's complain that my my monitor has like big

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.350 align:start position:0%
complain that my my monitor has like big resolutions. If things are too small,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.949 align:start position:0%
resolutions. If things are too small, just let me know. I can I can increase

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.110 align:start position:0%
just let me know. I can I can increase it a little further. So I'll just start

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.630 align:start position:0%
it a little further. So I'll just start with with the basic. Here you're seeing

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.630 align:start position:0%
with with the basic. Here you're seeing the the link to Stellar CLI and I'll

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.149 align:start position:0%
the the link to Stellar CLI and I'll take these steps back and start from the

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.830 align:start position:0%
take these steps back and start from the very beginning. So if you're a new

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.309 align:start position:0%
very beginning. So if you're a new developer coming to the ecosystem not

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
developer coming to the ecosystem not sure if you heard it up it already but

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
sure if you heard it up it already but Stellar CLI it's a great tool everyone

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.670 align:start position:0%
Stellar CLI it's a great tool everyone should have it and it's the the starting

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
should have it and it's the the starting point for what we're doing here. So I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
point for what we're doing here. So I recommend you go here to to Stellar

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.390 align:start position:0%
recommend you go here to to Stellar Stellar CLI get the CLI installed and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.390 align:start position:0%
Stellar CLI get the CLI installed and we'll start with it. So Stellar CLI has

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.630 align:start position:0%
we'll start with it. So Stellar CLI has a lot of very very exciting features.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
a lot of very very exciting features. You can manage accounts. You can spin up

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.789 align:start position:0%
You can manage accounts. You can spin up your own container with a local network.

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.550 align:start position:0%
your own container with a local network. You can do a bunch of of really cool

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
You can do a bunch of of really cool stuff. But the nice thing that just came

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
stuff. But the nice thing that just came in recently and a lot of people might

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.229 align:start position:0%
in recently and a lot of people might not have realized in in in past

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.310 align:start position:0%
not have realized in in in past releases is that now we have plugins for

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.069 align:start position:0%
releases is that now we have plugins for the CLI. So if you have the CLI

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
the CLI. So if you have the CLI installed and you just go ahead and hit

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.469 align:start position:0%
installed and you just go ahead and hit stellar stellar space plugin and

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
stellar stellar space plugin and let's call search, you'll be able to

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.189 align:start position:0%
let's call search, you'll be able to search for plugins that are are

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.110 align:start position:0%
search for plugins that are are published in the ecosystem and that can

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.790 align:start position:0%
published in the ecosystem and that can be installed on the CLI. So the idea

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.710 align:start position:0%
be installed on the CLI. So the idea behind that is that different projects

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
behind that is that different projects might have specific needs or might look

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.510 align:start position:0%
might have specific needs or might look for more personalized tooling for what

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.110 align:start position:0%
for more personalized tooling for what they're building and this way you can

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.870 align:start position:0%
they're building and this way you can really customize your experience around

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
really customize your experience around it. So what we're seeing here is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.189 align:start position:0%
it. So what we're seeing here is basically it went through repositories

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
basically it went through repositories that have a specific tag it looks for. I

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.629 align:start position:0%
that have a specific tag it looks for. I mean these were

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.150 align:start position:0%
mean these were &gt;&gt; zoom in a little bit. It's it's a little

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; zoom in a little bit. It's it's a little bit hard to see.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.189 align:start position:0%
bit hard to see. &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Is it better like

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Is it better like that? Like that it's huge my screen.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.110 align:start position:0%
that? Like that it's huge my screen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now it's now it's

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now it's now it's really good. It's very easy to see.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
really good. It's very easy to see. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. So basically it just

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. So basically it just found for hits and it's looking on

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
found for hits and it's looking on GitHub for a specific tag to indicate

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.830 align:start position:0%
GitHub for a specific tag to indicate this is a plug-in for the CLI and we can

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.029 align:start position:0%
this is a plug-in for the CLI and we can see a bunch of interesting stuff

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.469 align:start position:0%
see a bunch of interesting stuff already. So there is the scaffold

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.790 align:start position:0%
already. So there is the scaffold stellar it's in a repository called a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.749 align:start position:0%
stellar it's in a repository called a lababscaffold stellar there's also you

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
lababscaffold stellar there's also you can see the contract bindings there is

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.469 align:start position:0%
can see the contract bindings there is the open zeppelink upgrader so the cla

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.629 align:start position:0%
the open zeppelink upgrader so the cla for for contracts and we should be

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.230 align:start position:0%
for for contracts and we should be seeing a lot of a lot more exciting

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of a lot more exciting stuff coming next so for this demo

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
stuff coming next so for this demo we'll go with the scaffold stellar I

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.110 align:start position:0%
we'll go with the scaffold stellar I already have it installed I'll just open

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.070 align:start position:0%
already have it installed I'll just open the repo here you can access github

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.150 align:start position:0%
the repo here you can access github and iabscaffoldstellar

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.469 align:start position:0%
and iabscaffoldstellar and you can go through the instructions

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.029 align:start position:0%
and you can go through the instructions here to It's very simple. Just cargo

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
here to It's very simple. Just cargo install and you have the CLI. I already

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
install and you have the CLI. I already have it here. So, it's probably just

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.629 align:start position:0%
have it here. So, it's probably just Yeah, there you go. I have P V P V P V P

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
Yeah, there you go. I have P V P V P V P V P V P V P V P V P V P V 005. we

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
V P V P V P V P V P V P V 005. we also have the registry which is

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.390 align:start position:0%
also have the registry which is something really exciting but I won't be

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.990 align:start position:0%
something really exciting but I won't be focusing too much on this on this on

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.909 align:start position:0%
focusing too much on this on this on this demo in function of time. So, I

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.749 align:start position:0%
this demo in function of time. So, I think we can have subsequent sessions

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
think we can have subsequent sessions just to go deeper into some of the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.270 align:start position:0%
just to go deeper into some of the features that won't be here. I'll try to

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.110 align:start position:0%
features that won't be here. I'll try to focus more on initializing the the

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.029 align:start position:0%
focus more on initializing the the project and and playing around with it.

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.790 align:start position:0%
project and and playing around with it. So, I have it installed. Once you have

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.230 align:start position:0%
So, I have it installed. Once you have the plug-in installed, you can access

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.830 align:start position:0%
the plug-in installed, you can access those through the stellar CLA directly.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.870 align:start position:0%
those through the stellar CLA directly. So I'll go with stellar scaffold. Just

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.070 align:start position:0%
So I'll go with stellar scaffold. Just hit h to see the help and you get a

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.830 align:start position:0%
hit h to see the help and you get a bunch of new commands with the this

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.550 align:start position:0%
bunch of new commands with the this plug-in. So in it will allows you allow

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
plug-in. So in it will allows you allow you to start a new project from scratch

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.230 align:start position:0%
you to start a new project from scratch and it comes with this pretty exciting

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.469 align:start position:0%
and it comes with this pretty exciting model repo that you can manage your

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.909 align:start position:0%
model repo that you can manage your contracts. You can build the contracts,

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.909 align:start position:0%
contracts. You can build the contracts, generate the clients, have you have a

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.749 align:start position:0%
generate the clients, have you have a front end that's ready to interact and

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
front end that's ready to interact and integrate with these clients. So it's

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.749 align:start position:0%
integrate with these clients. So it's really neat. You have a build a build

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.670 align:start position:0%
really neat. You have a build a build function that not just builds the

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.710 align:start position:0%
function that not just builds the contract but also runs certain routines

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
contract but also runs certain routines that I'll be showing afterwards that are

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.309 align:start position:0%
that I'll be showing afterwards that are associated with the configuration you

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.029 align:start position:0%
associated with the configuration you have in your environment. You have also

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.790 align:start position:0%
have in your environment. You have also the generate command which allows you to

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.350 align:start position:0%
the generate command which allows you to generate new contracts. So these

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.590 align:start position:0%
generate new contracts. So these allow you to go through through the

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
allow you to go through through the open Zeppelink examples and it can send

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.230 align:start position:0%
open Zeppelink examples and it can send you to the to the open Zeppelin wizard

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
you to the to the open Zeppelin wizard and there's a bunch of new stuff coming

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.150 align:start position:0%
and there's a bunch of new stuff coming in the future as well. you can

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
in the future as well. you can upgrade existing repositories for the

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.390 align:start position:0%
upgrade existing repositories for the scaffold turning into your your

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.870 align:start position:0%
scaffold turning into your your workspace into a scaffold project.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.790 align:start position:0%
workspace into a scaffold project. there's the update just to update your

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
there's the update just to update your environments in in your in your working

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.629 align:start position:0%
environments in in your in your working space and also watch which I'll be

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.189 align:start position:0%
space and also watch which I'll be using a lot in this demo that builds

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
using a lot in this demo that builds everything and keep watching for changes

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.510 align:start position:0%
everything and keep watching for changes on both sides. So both the contracts and

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
on both sides. So both the contracts and also the front end. So for this let's go

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.909 align:start position:0%
also the front end. So for this let's go ahead and and start new project. I'll

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
ahead and and start new project. I'll just go with stellar scaffold in it

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:37.909 align:start position:0%
just go with stellar scaffold in it and let's call it demo 10. I think I

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
and let's call it demo 10. I think I have a bunch of demos already in this

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.550 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of demos already in this folder because I was playing with this

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.790 align:start position:0%
folder because I was playing with this throughout these past few days. Let's

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.230 align:start position:0%
throughout these past few days. Let's just see. Yes, cd. I'll just open this

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.909 align:start position:0%
just see. Yes, cd. I'll just open this new project. And you can see here that

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:51.110 align:start position:0%
new project. And you can see here that it downloaded the repository from

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
it downloaded the repository from scaffold stellar front end. So if you

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
scaffold stellar front end. So if you want to have a look at these or even

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.990 align:start position:0%
want to have a look at these or even submit PRs if you find anything to

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.749 align:start position:0%
submit PRs if you find anything to improve feel free to do that. So I'll go

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
improve feel free to do that. So I'll go ahead and see the demo. I'm in the in

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
ahead and see the demo. I'm in the in the folder and let me open it with VS

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
the folder and let me open it with VS Code. So there's my VS Code. Let me just

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
Code. So there's my VS Code. Let me just position it here and really increase

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.070 align:start position:0%
position it here and really increase this so you guys can see what's going

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
this so you guys can see what's going on. So all right, starting in this new

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:18.469 align:start position:0%
on. So all right, starting in this new repo. What do I have in here? What where

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.230 align:start position:0%
repo. What do I have in here? What where is this structure? What am I seeing in

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
is this structure? What am I seeing in this? So just a quick walk through what

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.350 align:start position:0%
this? So just a quick walk through what you're seeing here on top you have a

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here on top you have a folder for contracts and this is

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
folder for contracts and this is basically where your contracts are going

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.150 align:start position:0%
basically where your contracts are going to live. They are following this format

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.389 align:start position:0%
to live. They are following this format in which you have a directory for each f

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.310 align:start position:0%
in which you have a directory for each f for each contract you have the cargo

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.630 align:start position:0%
for each contract you have the cargo tommo source and out of the bat you can

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
tommo source and out of the bat you can see we have three examples. this is

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.909 align:start position:0%
see we have three examples. this is something that as is in this current

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.909 align:start position:0%
something that as is in this current format and also it's important to bring

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.750 align:start position:0%
format and also it's important to bring the disclaimer that everything here is a

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
the disclaimer that everything here is a work in progress. This is very recent.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.509 align:start position:0%
work in progress. This is very recent. So if you see any bugs or anything that

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.829 align:start position:0%
So if you see any bugs or anything that we could be improved, feel free to to to

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.590 align:start position:0%
we could be improved, feel free to to to share your feedback. We appreciate and

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.509 align:start position:0%
share your feedback. We appreciate and there's definitely a lot of stuff that

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.430 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a lot of stuff that will be iterating and improving over the

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.790 align:start position:0%
will be iterating and improving over the the new releases, the following

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.870 align:start position:0%
the new releases, the following releases. So you see under contracts

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
releases. So you see under contracts here, I have a funible token from the

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
here, I have a funible token from the demos. I have a hello world example and

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
demos. I have a hello world example and I have the NFT innumerable which is also

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.509 align:start position:0%
I have the NFT innumerable which is also different example of contract. So

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0%
different example of contract. So contracts is where your rust code

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.230 align:start position:0%
contracts is where your rust code exists. This is all a big workspace and

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.310 align:start position:0%
exists. This is all a big workspace and you can see the the source code

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
you can see the the source code directly. If you scroll a little bit,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.470 align:start position:0%
directly. If you scroll a little bit, you see packages. Right now, this is

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.870 align:start position:0%
you see packages. Right now, this is empty. So where is this packages folder?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
empty. So where is this packages folder? The idea is that as I'm building these

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.670 align:start position:0%
The idea is that as I'm building these contracts, we are automatically

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.590 align:start position:0%
contracts, we are automatically going through our configuration and

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
going through our configuration and deploying these contracts and generating

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
deploying these contracts and generating the TypeScript binds. So we are creating

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
the TypeScript binds. So we are creating clients for these in Typescript and

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
clients for these in Typescript and putting those in this folder. So all the

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
putting those in this folder. So all the clients that are generated for the

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
clients that are generated for the contracts will come to the package

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
contracts will come to the package folder and that's where they're going to

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
folder and that's where they're going to be accessed from. So if I go down below

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.110 align:start position:0%
be accessed from. So if I go down below you'll see that we also have a front end

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.710 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we also have a front end here. So this is a this is a ReactJS

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.829 align:start position:0%
here. So this is a this is a ReactJS with TypeScript and D and here in this

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.389 align:start position:0%
with TypeScript and D and here in this front end basically it is a a very

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
front end basically it is a a very bare bones and simple front end to start

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.470 align:start position:0%
bare bones and simple front end to start playing with your contract. But it also

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.389 align:start position:0%
playing with your contract. But it also includes some some interesting thing the

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
includes some some interesting thing the bat. You're going to see it has some

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.710 align:start position:0%
bat. You're going to see it has some providers and some hooks that you can

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.230 align:start position:0%
providers and some hooks that you can use in your application and you can see

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
use in your application and you can see the actual implementation we have in

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
the actual implementation we have in place to play around with those. you

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.350 align:start position:0%
place to play around with those. you also have the contracts folder which for

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
also have the contracts folder which for now it's empty but as soon as I start

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
now it's empty but as soon as I start building the the contracts you see it's

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.670 align:start position:0%
building the the contracts you see it's being populated with the clients for

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.509 align:start position:0%
being populated with the clients for each contract and you have the debug

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:28.069 align:start position:0%
each contract and you have the debug folder which is this interesting

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:30.310 align:start position:0%
folder which is this interesting contract explorer that is very similar

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.710 align:start position:0%
contract explorer that is very similar to what we have in stellar lab and I'll

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.949 align:start position:0%
to what we have in stellar lab and I'll get into more details in a second. So

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:37.190 align:start position:0%
get into more details in a second. So for now it's bare bones. We don't have

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.509 align:start position:0%
for now it's bare bones. We don't have anything. So what can we do? What can we

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
anything. So what can we do? What can we start doing with this? the first

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.990 align:start position:0%
start doing with this? the first step, let me go ahead and just open the

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.670 align:start position:0%
step, let me go ahead and just open the rhymi here. And it suggests us to start

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.190 align:start position:0%
rhymi here. And it suggests us to start with this copying the amp. So I'll just

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
with this copying the amp. So I'll just copy the example end. Now we have the

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.310 align:start position:0%
copy the example end. Now we have the end. And this is basically telling us

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
end. And this is basically telling us which environment are we using. This is

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
which environment are we using. This is where our front end is going to look

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.509 align:start position:0%
where our front end is going to look when connecting to our RPC and to our

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.829 align:start position:0%
when connecting to our RPC and to our horizon. Oh, and I didn't mention what I

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:08.150 align:start position:0%
horizon. Oh, and I didn't mention what I actually Let me just show here because

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.150 align:start position:0%
actually Let me just show here because I'm so used to have this up and running.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.670 align:start position:0%
I'm so used to have this up and running. I'm already running my local image of

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.190 align:start position:0%
I'm already running my local image of the the the quick start. So if you never

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.870 align:start position:0%
the the the quick start. So if you never heard of it, if you don't you don't know

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
heard of it, if you don't you don't know what it is, basically in the stellar

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.190 align:start position:0%
what it is, basically in the stellar CLI, you have a container. You can run

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.990 align:start position:0%
CLI, you have a container. You can run stellar container start and you start

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.430 align:start position:0%
stellar container start and you start this container locally, a docker

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.509 align:start position:0%
this container locally, a docker container with an image that has all

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.670 align:start position:0%
container with an image that has all that you need to run stellar locally. So

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.949 align:start position:0%
that you need to run stellar locally. So you have your own node running locally

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:39.030 align:start position:0%
you have your own node running locally from scratch pream pristine node

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.069 align:start position:0%
from scratch pream pristine node history. You have your own RPC. You have

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:44.069 align:start position:0%
history. You have your own RPC. You have your own horizon. You you have your

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
your own horizon. You you have your friend bot. So it's really handy.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
friend bot. So it's really handy. right now I'll be using it to connect

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
right now I'll be using it to connect and deploying everything locally in my

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
and deploying everything locally in my environment. And just an example I

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.630 align:start position:0%
environment. And just an example I was showing the the the commands from

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
was showing the the the commands from the from the scaffold CLI. So I'll just

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
the from the scaffold CLI. So I'll just to show you these relationship between

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.710 align:start position:0%
to show you these relationship between contracts and packages. I'll go ahead

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
contracts and packages. I'll go ahead and just run a build so you can see how

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.509 align:start position:0%
and just run a build so you can see how it does. basically if I access

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
it does. basically if I access stellar

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.190 align:start position:0%
stellar scaffold

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.230 align:start position:0%
scaffold build let me just do the the help so

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.870 align:start position:0%
build let me just do the the help so you can see all the options. So

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.190 align:start position:0%
you can see all the options. So basically you can build for a specific

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
basically you can build for a specific amp and it's going to look for this

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
amp and it's going to look for this stellar scaffold and which points to

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.829 align:start position:0%
stellar scaffold and which points to which environment you are building your

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
which environment you are building your contracts. I have mine already set

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.629 align:start position:0%
contracts. I have mine already set here to development. So you can build

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:33.990 align:start position:0%
here to development. So you can build your contracts for for different

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.230 align:start position:0%
your contracts for for different environments. And what these are doing

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.870 align:start position:0%
environments. And what these are doing is that they are also looking into this

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.829 align:start position:0%
is that they are also looking into this file over here. This environment to this

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:43.190 align:start position:0%
file over here. This environment to this is very important for this scaffold

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.190 align:start position:0%
is very important for this scaffold project because this defines how you're

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
project because this defines how you're handling this environment. So I I

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.389 align:start position:0%
handling this environment. So I I suggest you all have a look and play

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:52.069 align:start position:0%
suggest you all have a look and play around. There's a ton of comments here

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.230 align:start position:0%
around. There's a ton of comments here to guide you through this configuration.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.470 align:start position:0%
to guide you through this configuration. But in short summary, what you're seeing

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.710 align:start position:0%
But in short summary, what you're seeing is you have three main environments. You

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
is you have three main environments. You see here we have a development

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.150 align:start position:0%
see here we have a development environment with the configuration for

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
environment with the configuration for the RPC that we'll be using the

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.110 align:start position:0%
the RPC that we'll be using the passphrase setting up to run

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.670 align:start position:0%
passphrase setting up to run automatically. So when this flag is set

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.949 align:start position:0%
automatically. So when this flag is set for example and I'm running npm rundev,

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.790 align:start position:0%
for example and I'm running npm rundev, it's going to automatically start the

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.470 align:start position:0%
it's going to automatically start the container for me. So I don't have to do

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.629 align:start position:0%
container for me. So I don't have to do that or in case I forget. I do this all

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:20.310 align:start position:0%
that or in case I forget. I do this all the time whenever I'm working on my

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.629 align:start position:0%
the time whenever I'm working on my projects. you also have some other

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:24.710 align:start position:0%
projects. you also have some other configuration around the accounts. So

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.629 align:start position:0%
configuration around the accounts. So this is also very neat. I'll get to into

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
this is also very neat. I'll get to into more details but important things here

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.910 align:start position:0%
more details but important things here is that you also have other

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
is that you also have other environments. You have the staging

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
environments. You have the staging environment. You have the production

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
environment. You have the production environment. So normally you would have

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.430 align:start position:0%
environment. So normally you would have development pointing to local. You would

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
development pointing to local. You would have staging pointing to test net or

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.190 align:start position:0%
have staging pointing to test net or future net. And then you'd have

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.230 align:start position:0%
future net. And then you'd have production pointing to mainet. So I

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.230 align:start position:0%
production pointing to mainet. So I won't make any changes right now just to

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.790 align:start position:0%
won't make any changes right now just to show you guys. If I run the command to

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
show you guys. If I run the command to scaff stellar scaffold build with the

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
scaff stellar scaffold build with the flag build clients.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.829 align:start position:0%
flag build clients. there you go. It's it's starting

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
there you go. It's it's starting to run. You see that it's doing a lot of

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.150 align:start position:0%
to run. You see that it's doing a lot of stuff. Let me just break it down for

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
stuff. Let me just break it down for you. So basically what it's going

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
you. So basically what it's going through it's going through all my

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
through it's going through all my contracts building each one of those. As

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.350 align:start position:0%
contracts building each one of those. As they're building the contracts they're

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
they're building the contracts they're also looking at these environments to

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.030 align:start position:0%
also looking at these environments to see what I have set up here. So

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.670 align:start position:0%
see what I have set up here. So important pieces. So first thing you'll

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.269 align:start position:0%
important pieces. So first thing you'll notice you have this development.ac

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.509 align:start position:0%
notice you have this development.ac accounts which defines which accounts

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.430 align:start position:0%
accounts which defines which accounts are going to be used and by default you

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
are going to be used and by default you have this with an account called me and

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
have this with an account called me and the full true. What does that mean? That

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.949 align:start position:0%
the full true. What does that mean? That means that if you're familiar with the

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:37.670 align:start position:0%
means that if you're familiar with the stellar CLI you have the stellar keys

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
stellar CLI you have the stellar keys which allow you to if I just hit ls here

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.069 align:start position:0%
which allow you to if I just hit ls here I can you can see the keys I have. It

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.990 align:start position:0%
I can you can see the keys I have. It allow you to manage key pairs directly

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.829 align:start position:0%
allow you to manage key pairs directly from the CLI. So you can create new key

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
from the CLI. So you can create new key pairs, you can initialize these accounts

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.509 align:start position:0%
pairs, you can initialize these accounts and you can use these accounts to run

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
and you can use these accounts to run transactions directly through the CLI.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.629 align:start position:0%
transactions directly through the CLI. So the nice thing here is that as you

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.030 align:start position:0%
So the nice thing here is that as you set these accounts here automatically

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.110 align:start position:0%
set these accounts here automatically doing the build, it's going to identify

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
doing the build, it's going to identify if I have an account called me or not.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.430 align:start position:0%
if I have an account called me or not. And in case I don't, it's going to

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.110 align:start position:0%
And in case I don't, it's going to create this account and initialize it

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
create this account and initialize it for me. And with the default equals true

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.790 align:start position:0%
for me. And with the default equals true flag, it is going to use this account to

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.389 align:start position:0%
flag, it is going to use this account to deploy the contracts as the source of

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:14.470 align:start position:0%
deploy the contracts as the source of the transactions. So for example, if you

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.230 align:start position:0%
the transactions. So for example, if you are spinning up a bunch of contracts

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.389 align:start position:0%
are spinning up a bunch of contracts which have the same admin, you could set

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:20.310 align:start position:0%
which have the same admin, you could set up this as the admin account and have

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.030 align:start position:0%
up this as the admin account and have the admin deploy all the contracts.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
the admin deploy all the contracts. down below you have here also the

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.470 align:start position:0%
down below you have here also the development contracts which specifies

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.670 align:start position:0%
development contracts which specifies which contracts the build command should

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.670 align:start position:0%
which contracts the build command should should build for these

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.829 align:start position:0%
should build for these environments. So here for example it

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
environments. So here for example it comes out of the bat already

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.870 align:start position:0%
comes out of the bat already preconfigured with the contracts we have

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.949 align:start position:0%
preconfigured with the contracts we have here as examples. So you have the hello

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:42.150 align:start position:0%
here as examples. So you have the hello world and this inline syntax saying

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.829 align:start position:0%
world and this inline syntax saying that I want to generate the client for

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.230 align:start position:0%
that I want to generate the client for it. So basically the hello world down

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.069 align:start position:0%
it. So basically the hello world down below we have the funible token which

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
below we have the funible token which also is generating the clients but you

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.790 align:start position:0%
also is generating the clients but you can see down below it has something

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.350 align:start position:0%
can see down below it has something else. You can already set the

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
else. You can already set the constructor args directly into this

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.030 align:start position:0%
constructor args directly into this format and you can use the accounts that

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.509 align:start position:0%
format and you can use the accounts that are specified on top to be used

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
are specified on top to be used parameters as arguments. So here it's

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.670 align:start position:0%
parameters as arguments. So here it's already invoking the constructor

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.150 align:start position:0%
already invoking the constructor arguments sorry the constructor function

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.710 align:start position:0%
arguments sorry the constructor function for my funible token setting the owner

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.749 align:start position:0%
for my funible token setting the owner as the MI account and an initial supply

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.550 align:start position:0%
as the MI account and an initial supply and the same thing for the NFT contract

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
and the same thing for the NFT contract as well. It's set in the owner and you

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.629 align:start position:0%
as well. It's set in the owner and you can also play around with these because

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
can also play around with these because you can add post initialization

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.069 align:start position:0%
you can add post initialization commands. So you can have for example

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
commands. So you can have for example this after deploy and you can chain new

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.069 align:start position:0%
this after deploy and you can chain new commands after everything is deployed if

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.829 align:start position:0%
commands after everything is deployed if you want to run a specific

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:37.590 align:start position:0%
you want to run a specific configuration. So let's say that after

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
configuration. So let's say that after deploying everything and initializing

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.350 align:start position:0%
deploying everything and initializing the contract you already want out of the

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
the contract you already want out of the bat to mint some units to send to some

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.749 align:start position:0%
bat to mint some units to send to some accounts to send around some tokens. So

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:47.749 align:start position:0%
accounts to send around some tokens. So you can do that very easily. So you see

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
you can do that very easily. So you see a lot of stuff ran here. Actually I

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.350 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff ran here. Actually I ended up jumping a few steps. So we

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
ended up jumping a few steps. So we just have the the the contracts and the

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
just have the the the contracts and the packages and you can see those were

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
packages and you can see those were generated based on the contracts we have

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
generated based on the contracts we have specified here. So all of the TypeScript

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.669 align:start position:0%
specified here. So all of the TypeScript packages and this also filled in the

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:07.750 align:start position:0%
packages and this also filled in the contracts for my front end. So we can

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
contracts for my front end. So we can start playing with this front end. All

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
start playing with this front end. All right. So let's let's get back to

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:14.710 align:start position:0%
right. So let's let's get back to repository. I just initialized this

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.710 align:start position:0%
repository. I just initialized this project. What are the steps that I need

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.870 align:start position:0%
project. What are the steps that I need to do as a fresh project? So we just

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.029 align:start position:0%
to do as a fresh project? So we just copied the MV. Now what we need to do,

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.630 align:start position:0%
copied the MV. Now what we need to do, we need to install the dependencies

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.029 align:start position:0%
we need to install the dependencies because we have a bunch of of

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.470 align:start position:0%
because we have a bunch of of dependencies that we are going to need

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.070 align:start position:0%
dependencies that we are going to need for example to run the concurrency and

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.549 align:start position:0%
for example to run the concurrency and so on. So npmi just run the

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:38.310 align:start position:0%
so on. So npmi just run the installation. Wait a little bit.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
installation. Wait a little bit. Let's just close this other one for a

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.549 align:start position:0%
Let's just close this other one for a second. Okay, everything's installed.

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:45.750 align:start position:0%
second. Okay, everything's installed. What is the next step? npm rundev. So as

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.230 align:start position:0%
What is the next step? npm rundev. So as you run npm rundev, you see a lot of

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.230 align:start position:0%
you run npm rundev, you see a lot of things going on here. And this is where

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.029 align:start position:0%
things going on here. And this is where I think the magic lies. So, and yeah,

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:56.150 align:start position:0%
I think the magic lies. So, and yeah, run that. And a lot of stuff is running.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.390 align:start position:0%
run that. And a lot of stuff is running. I'll just go back and show you as it's

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.390 align:start position:0%
I'll just go back and show you as it's scrolling down. So, you see that out of

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
scrolling down. So, you see that out of the bat, it starts concurrently two

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.909 align:start position:0%
the bat, it starts concurrently two commands. It starts stellar scaffold

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
commands. It starts stellar scaffold watch with the build client flag and

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
watch with the build client flag and also vit. So, these go two are running

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.270 align:start position:0%
also vit. So, these go two are running in separate process. You can see right

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.510 align:start position:0%
in separate process. You can see right away that vit's running here on number

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.669 align:start position:0%
away that vit's running here on number one and on number zero. You can see the

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
one and on number zero. You can see the whole building the building

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
whole building the building commands that I that I showed before. So

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.830 align:start position:0%
commands that I that I showed before. So I'll go ahead and click here to open the

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.669 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and click here to open the front end. It's already there. And let

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
front end. It's already there. And let me just see if it finished building

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.510 align:start position:0%
me just see if it finished building everything we had already built. So it's

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.669 align:start position:0%
everything we had already built. So it's basically just repeated everything. But

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.310 align:start position:0%
basically just repeated everything. But there we go. We have our front end. All

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.789 align:start position:0%
there we go. We have our front end. All right. It's a very simple one. it

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.150 align:start position:0%
right. It's a very simple one. it starts with some instructions telling

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
starts with some instructions telling you what you can do and how you can do.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.350 align:start position:0%
you what you can do and how you can do. But let me just break it down what

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
But let me just break it down what you're seeing here in your interface.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.190 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here in your interface. back. first thing you notice it came

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.110 align:start position:0%
back. first thing you notice it came automatically connected to my account.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.029 align:start position:0%
automatically connected to my account. Why is that FIFO? Well, that's mainly

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.789 align:start position:0%
Why is that FIFO? Well, that's mainly because I have been using this already

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
because I have been using this already and we we we have some account

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.390 align:start position:0%
and we we we have some account management logic here that stores

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.549 align:start position:0%
management logic here that stores locally in the local storage the account

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
locally in the local storage the account that is last connected. So once you come

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:04.710 align:start position:0%
that is last connected. So once you come back it's going to identify it has been

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.110 align:start position:0%
back it's going to identify it has been connected and just reused that one. But

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.909 align:start position:0%
connected and just reused that one. But I can just come on top here and switch

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
I can just come on top here and switch accounts like or I can come here click

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
accounts like or I can come here click on something. There you go. Click and

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.150 align:start position:0%
on something. There you go. Click and disconnect if you want to see what is

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.669 align:start position:0%
disconnect if you want to see what is the the fresh start for the first time

00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:20.630 align:start position:0%
the the fresh start for the first time you access. what is important to note

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
you access. what is important to note here here I'm using freighter and if

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
here here I'm using freighter and if you're using freighter you should set it

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.630 align:start position:0%
you're using freighter you should set it to a custom network because I'm using

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
to a custom network because I'm using the local one. So if you never done that

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.430 align:start position:0%
the local one. So if you never done that in the past you go to settings navigate

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.669 align:start position:0%
in the past you go to settings navigate to network and you can set here a custom

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
to network and you can set here a custom network. If you're running on test net

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.950 align:start position:0%
network. If you're running on test net or mainet you're good to go because you

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.470 align:start position:0%
or mainet you're good to go because you can simply select the networks that

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.310 align:start position:0%
can simply select the networks that you're running. But in case of a custom

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.990 align:start position:0%
you're running. But in case of a custom one, you just need to input the same

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.150 align:start position:0%
one, you just need to input the same parameters we have in the end. So what

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.669 align:start position:0%
parameters we have in the end. So what is your RPC URL? What is your horizon

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
is your RPC URL? What is your horizon URL? What is the passphrase and allow

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
URL? What is the passphrase and allow for HTTP connections? there is

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.669 align:start position:0%
for HTTP connections? there is something on my my my local environment

00:19:57.679 --> 00:19:59.590 align:start position:0%
something on my my my local environment here and I'm still trying to figure out

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.029 align:start position:0%
here and I'm still trying to figure out what is going on. But sometimes it

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
what is going on. But sometimes it struggles with freighter and it doesn't

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.870 align:start position:0%
struggles with freighter and it doesn't show up the the proper balance. But I

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.870 align:start position:0%
show up the the proper balance. But I see it's something related specifically

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.029 align:start position:0%
see it's something related specifically to this to this environment I'm running.

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.549 align:start position:0%
to this to this environment I'm running. But it's it's going to work. Everything

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
But it's it's going to work. Everything is fine. I'll be showing to you guys.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.789 align:start position:0%
is fine. I'll be showing to you guys. So, if I click here on connect, you see

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:17.669 align:start position:0%
So, if I click here on connect, you see that we're using the Stellar wallet kit.

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
that we're using the Stellar wallet kit. This is a nice library we have in the

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.190 align:start position:0%
This is a nice library we have in the ecosystem, which basically connects to

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.190 align:start position:0%
ecosystem, which basically connects to several different wallets in the

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.430 align:start position:0%
several different wallets in the ecosystems and it's just one integration

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.149 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and it's just one integration you make and you're good to go. So, here

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.909 align:start position:0%
you make and you're good to go. So, here I have these two wallets installed

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.669 align:start position:0%
I have these two wallets installed here, but it supports way more wallets.

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:34.789 align:start position:0%
here, but it supports way more wallets. I'll just go with Freder. And wait a

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
I'll just go with Freder. And wait a second. Did I click it? Oh, something's

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
second. Did I click it? Oh, something's going on. What happened? Oh, there you

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
going on. What happened? Oh, there you go. Not sure what happened. I think my

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.390 align:start position:0%
go. Not sure what happened. I think my my my computer is frying because

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.190 align:start position:0%
my my computer is frying because everything just slowed down. Oh my god.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.190 align:start position:0%
everything just slowed down. Oh my god. I'm not sure what's going on. Let me

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what's going on. Let me just double check if it's there's an

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.310 align:start position:0%
just double check if it's there's an issue here. Right is not available. Oh,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.909 align:start position:0%
issue here. Right is not available. Oh, what is going on? Did my did my plugin

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:58.470 align:start position:0%
what is going on? Did my did my plugin just just die?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.270 align:start position:0%
just just die? Oh, what the hell happened here?

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.909 align:start position:0%
Oh, what the hell happened here? Let me just Yeah, I should definitely

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:08.149 align:start position:0%
Let me just Yeah, I should definitely open the tickets with Fred. Let me just

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:11.669 align:start position:0%
open the tickets with Fred. Let me just try and

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.630 align:start position:0%
kill everything from scratch. Oh, no. I can't do that. Otherwise, I'll be out of

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.190 align:start position:0%
can't do that. Otherwise, I'll be out of the session. Let me just try it again

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.029 align:start position:0%
the session. Let me just try it again once. , is there a way I can maybe

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
once. , is there a way I can maybe restart the extension?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.870 align:start position:0%
restart the extension? , where is Can I just do this and

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.230 align:start position:0%
, where is Can I just do this and bring it back?

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.029 align:start position:0%
bring it back? Let me see.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.830 align:start position:0%
Oh, there you go. It's popping me for my password. Is this correct? There you

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
my password. Is this correct? There you go. Okay, I think it's going on now. Not

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.149 align:start position:0%
go. Okay, I think it's going on now. Not sure what's going on. I'll definitely

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
sure what's going on. I'll definitely open a ticket for for the demo gods

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
open a ticket for for the demo gods blessing us.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
blessing us. Okay, so I connected my freighter

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
Okay, so I connected my freighter wallet. What you see here, it

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.549 align:start position:0%
wallet. What you see here, it automatically brings the balance and we

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.470 align:start position:0%
automatically brings the balance and we have this small indicator here in the

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
have this small indicator here in the top which checks what is the

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
top which checks what is the environment that you have set here in

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
environment that you have set here in your local environment and it indicates

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.270 align:start position:0%
your local environment and it indicates if you're connected to that or in case

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.110 align:start position:0%
if you're connected to that or in case you're not in case I'm connected to test

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
you're not in case I'm connected to test net for example in the wallet it's going

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
net for example in the wallet it's going to to throw a different message and

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.029 align:start position:0%
to to throw a different message and indicator just so you know that you're

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
indicator just so you know that you're not in the intended environment because

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.950 align:start position:0%
not in the intended environment because we want these front ends to be built for

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.870 align:start position:0%
we want these front ends to be built for a specific environment. So here I'm

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
a specific environment. So here I'm connected with my FIFO wallet and there

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.909 align:start position:0%
connected with my FIFO wallet and there you go. What can I do FIFO? What can

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:29.909 align:start position:0%
you go. What can I do FIFO? What can this front end do for me? What can I

00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:31.830 align:start position:0%
this front end do for me? What can I what can I use this for? So the nice

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
what can I use this for? So the nice thing starts once we click on this

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
thing starts once we click on this button over at the top. So if you're

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.070 align:start position:0%
button over at the top. So if you're familiar with stellar lab the

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.950 align:start position:0%
familiar with stellar lab the laboratory. You have a functionality

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.549 align:start position:0%
laboratory. You have a functionality there called I think it's called

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:44.789 align:start position:0%
there called I think it's called contract explorer as well that has the

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
contract explorer as well that has the invoke contract tab. Basically what we

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.590 align:start position:0%
invoke contract tab. Basically what we did is that we ported a good part of

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.669 align:start position:0%
did is that we ported a good part of that implementation over to here. And a

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
that implementation over to here. And a big shout out to to to to the team from

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.590 align:start position:0%
big shout out to to to to the team from from Stellar Lab that helped us through

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.510 align:start position:0%
from Stellar Lab that helped us through the process.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
the process. And what you're seeing here is that as I

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
And what you're seeing here is that as I open my front end, it automatically goes

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
open my front end, it automatically goes through my packages and the contracts I

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
through my packages and the contracts I have here. They load the clients, they

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
have here. They load the clients, they load the wasmas, they bring the whole

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.710 align:start position:0%
load the wasmas, they bring the whole spec for the client and show me this

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.789 align:start position:0%
spec for the client and show me this interface which allows me to directly

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:18.870 align:start position:0%
interface which allows me to directly interact with the contract in my local

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
interact with the contract in my local environment. So what you're seeing here

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
environment. So what you're seeing here are the three contracts I have here. I

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.909 align:start position:0%
are the three contracts I have here. I can simply click and switch which

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.070 align:start position:0%
can simply click and switch which contract I'm interact with and I can

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.510 align:start position:0%
contract I'm interact with and I can start invoking transaction invoking

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.630 align:start position:0%
start invoking transaction invoking functions from here. So I'll just go and

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.549 align:start position:0%
functions from here. So I'll just go and and show some examples. Let's go through

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.870 align:start position:0%
and show some examples. Let's go through the hello world. And if we check the

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
the hello world. And if we check the hello world contract, basically what it

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.549 align:start position:0%
hello world contract, basically what it does is that it has this hello function

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
does is that it has this hello function which receives an argument for two and

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
which receives an argument for two and say hello hello to the two arguments.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.710 align:start position:0%
say hello hello to the two arguments. So I'll go ahead and just say fo and

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.110 align:start position:0%
So I'll go ahead and just say fo and since I have my account connected I can

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
since I have my account connected I can both simulate or submit. I'll break

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.029 align:start position:0%
both simulate or submit. I'll break those into details. So I'll start just

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:01.510 align:start position:0%
those into details. So I'll start just with simulate. If I click simulate it's

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.430 align:start position:0%
with simulate. If I click simulate it's basically running the simulation of the

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.029 align:start position:0%
basically running the simulation of the transaction. And you see some stuff

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:07.029 align:start position:0%
transaction. And you see some stuff already changed. So okay, what changed

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:10.310 align:start position:0%
already changed. So okay, what changed here? First thing is it is using my

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.149 align:start position:0%
here? First thing is it is using my account that is connected here as the

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
account that is connected here as the source account of the transaction and is

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
source account of the transaction and is simulating an invocation with the

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.149 align:start position:0%
simulating an invocation with the parameters that I'm putting here. you

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:20.230 align:start position:0%
parameters that I'm putting here. you can see on top that it it showed this

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
can see on top that it it showed this flag to indicate it is a read

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
flag to indicate it is a read invocation. So that means that if I go

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
invocation. So that means that if I go ahead and submit this invocation to to

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.269 align:start position:0%
ahead and submit this invocation to to the network and it is processed, there's

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.669 align:start position:0%
the network and it is processed, there's no change in state. We're not changing

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:33.669 align:start position:0%
no change in state. We're not changing any state of the contract. So there's no

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
any state of the contract. So there's no real reason to actually submit and pay

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:38.070 align:start position:0%
real reason to actually submit and pay for the fees. If we just want to fetch

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.909 align:start position:0%
for the fees. If we just want to fetch some value or see some result, we can

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.750 align:start position:0%
some value or see some result, we can just simulate and see the result which

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.430 align:start position:0%
just simulate and see the result which is what we have down below. Here we have

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.269 align:start position:0%
is what we have down below. Here we have the response and the result of the

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
the response and the result of the simulation. So it is a successful one

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.909 align:start position:0%
simulation. So it is a successful one and you can click here on show details

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:51.669 align:start position:0%
and you can click here on show details and you expand the whole view and you

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
and you expand the whole view and you have the entire response. So if you

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.430 align:start position:0%
have the entire response. So if you scroll down if you're familiar with

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.669 align:start position:0%
scroll down if you're familiar with this, you see that we have these results

00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
this, you see that we have these results object and here we can see the the

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
object and here we can see the the return value. So it's saying hello FIFO

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.990 align:start position:0%
return value. So it's saying hello FIFO with the parameter that I I use. So if I

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.390 align:start position:0%
with the parameter that I I use. So if I say something different like hello John

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
say something different like hello John I'll simulate again. Show the details.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.350 align:start position:0%
I'll simulate again. Show the details. Go down below and there you go. Hello

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.950 align:start position:0%
Go down below and there you go. Hello John. Awesome. What else can you do?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.430 align:start position:0%
John. Awesome. What else can you do? let's try a different thing. let's

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.549 align:start position:0%
let's try a different thing. let's for example let's switch here and

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.870 align:start position:0%
for example let's switch here and make a new function and let's make some

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
make a new function and let's make some changes. Let's store a value. So, I

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.549 align:start position:0%
changes. Let's store a value. So, I think things start to get interesting as

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
think things start to get interesting as you start playing with your contracts

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.789 align:start position:0%
you start playing with your contracts and and and change things around. So,

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:35.590 align:start position:0%
and and and change things around. So, I'll just store let's say what can we

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.230 align:start position:0%
I'll just store let's say what can we send here? Let's send an address. So,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.029 align:start position:0%
send here? Let's send an address. So, let's send an address

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:45.990 align:start position:0%
let's send an address and it's address we don't return

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.549 align:start position:0%
and it's address we don't return anything and we'll just store these in

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:54.630 align:start position:0%
anything and we'll just store these in the in the storage. So just go ahead. M

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.510 align:start position:0%
the in the storage. So just go ahead. M do storage. Oh, there you go. Copilot.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.669 align:start position:0%
do storage. Oh, there you go. Copilot. Let me just double check. Set. No, this

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:02.230 align:start position:0%
Let me just double check. Set. No, this is wrong. This is wrong. Damn it.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.110 align:start position:0%
is wrong. This is wrong. Damn it. Copilot. So storage instance. Let's use

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.630 align:start position:0%
Copilot. So storage instance. Let's use instance for now. Is I have cold hands.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.870 align:start position:0%
instance for now. Is I have cold hands. instance set. Okay. let's use a

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.630 align:start position:0%
instance set. Okay. let's use a simple key. So single short. I think I

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.669 align:start position:0%
simple key. So single short. I think I might have to import this single short.

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
might have to import this single short. Let's just call my key for now. And the

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.510 align:start position:0%
Let's just call my key for now. And the value will be the address that we're

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
value will be the address that we're sending.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.909 align:start position:0%
sending. Okay, let me just save. Let's see. Where

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.549 align:start position:0%
Okay, let me just save. Let's see. Where am I? Oh, this should be There you

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.710 align:start position:0%
am I? Oh, this should be There you go. Let me just save it again. I think

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.350 align:start position:0%
go. Let me just save it again. I think this is good to go. Let's wait a little

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.230 align:start position:0%
this is good to go. Let's wait a little bit. You see that as soon as I'm saving

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.310 align:start position:0%
bit. You see that as soon as I'm saving everything is running again. So, it's

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
everything is running again. So, it's watching for changes in real time. And

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.590 align:start position:0%
watching for changes in real time. And as it identifies that I changed the the

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.630 align:start position:0%
as it identifies that I changed the the the the contract and it builds and it

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
the the contract and it builds and it notices that was different. Then it runs

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.310 align:start position:0%
notices that was different. Then it runs the whole routine. So it redeploys,

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.630 align:start position:0%
the whole routine. So it redeploys, reinitializes. And this is very very

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.549 align:start position:0%
reinitializes. And this is very very powerful because it means that as I'm

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.470 align:start position:0%
powerful because it means that as I'm making changes, it's identifying when

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.230 align:start position:0%
making changes, it's identifying when it's relevant and it redeploys. It

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
it's relevant and it redeploys. It regenerates everything. And if you paid

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.149 align:start position:0%
regenerates everything. And if you paid attention, you should have seen that the

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.750 align:start position:0%
attention, you should have seen that the front end already updated here on the

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.230 align:start position:0%
front end already updated here on the side. So I already have the starv

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
side. So I already have the starv showing up in here. So that's really

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
showing up in here. So that's really neat because it means that as I'm making

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.830 align:start position:0%
neat because it means that as I'm making changes, I can already invoke from the

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
changes, I can already invoke from the front end. So the star val here allow me

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
front end. So the star val here allow me to send an address. So I'll just copy my

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
to send an address. So I'll just copy my on address from here. We should

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
on address from here. We should definitely add the copy button here. So

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.950 align:start position:0%
definitely add the copy button here. So I'll just paste it here. I'll simulate.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.310 align:start position:0%
I'll just paste it here. I'll simulate. I see that I can send it. I can submit

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.549 align:start position:0%
I see that I can send it. I can submit this. But if you notice here on top now,

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:36.149 align:start position:0%
this. But if you notice here on top now, the badge is slightly different. Let me

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:37.990 align:start position:0%
the badge is slightly different. Let me close this. You see now it indicates

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
close this. You see now it indicates it's a right invocation. So this means

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
it's a right invocation. So this means that based on this simulation if I

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.669 align:start position:0%
that based on this simulation if I submit this I'll be changing some

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.190 align:start position:0%
submit this I'll be changing some value and storing some value in the

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.190 align:start position:0%
value and storing some value in the contract. So I'll go ahead I'll click in

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
contract. So I'll go ahead I'll click in submit and it's popping me up to sign.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.269 align:start position:0%
submit and it's popping me up to sign. this is just because of the the issue

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.789 align:start position:0%
this is just because of the the issue I mentioned here in my environment. It

00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.470 align:start position:0%
I mentioned here in my environment. It sometimes don't know I have balance but

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't know I have balance but there you go it was executed and here it

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
there you go it was executed and here it is. This is this oh damn it one password

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.750 align:start position:0%
is. This is this oh damn it one password it's going to be popping up. So what

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.269 align:start position:0%
it's going to be popping up. So what you're seeing here is the result of the

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:09.029 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here is the result of the submission and this is is slightly

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:11.909 align:start position:0%
submission and this is is slightly different. So it has the same compact

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:14.230 align:start position:0%
different. So it has the same compact version but I can click on details and I

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.470 align:start position:0%
version but I can click on details and I can expand. Oh should I just close this?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
can expand. Oh should I just close this? Can I just Yeah, let me just finish it.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.350 align:start position:0%
Can I just Yeah, let me just finish it. There you go. One password. So what

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.669 align:start position:0%
There you go. One password. So what you're seeing here as the the summary

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:25.430 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here as the the summary you have the hash of the transaction

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
you have the hash of the transaction have the ledger number for when it was

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.029 align:start position:0%
have the ledger number for when it was processed. you have the transaction

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:30.950 align:start position:0%
processed. you have the transaction envelope in XDR, but you can also click

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.830 align:start position:0%
envelope in XDR, but you can also click here and quickly switch to JSON and view

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
here and quickly switch to JSON and view the the JSON version of this object.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.269 align:start position:0%
the the JSON version of this object. The same thing for the result. You can

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:42.389 align:start position:0%
The same thing for the result. You can convert it to JSON and so on. So, this

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:45.110 align:start position:0%
convert it to JSON and so on. So, this is really nice. Okay. Oh, did it just

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
is really nice. Okay. Oh, did it just reopen? That's awful. Okay. Oh, it's

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
reopen? That's awful. Okay. Oh, it's because of this one. Let me just how

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.269 align:start position:0%
because of this one. Let me just how can I can I just disable it? Let me just

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:58.549 align:start position:0%
can I can I just disable it? Let me just go to the extensions real quick and

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.630 align:start position:0%
go to the extensions real quick and disable this guy so it doesn't pop up on

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.669 align:start position:0%
disable this guy so it doesn't pop up on our face. Okay, I was talking about the

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:06.149 align:start position:0%
our face. Okay, I was talking about the submission. So, I just submitted made a

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:08.070 align:start position:0%
submission. So, I just submitted made a change. What else is important to

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
change. What else is important to highlight here as you're playing with

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.669 align:start position:0%
highlight here as you're playing with these contracts and and you might have

00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:14.230 align:start position:0%
these contracts and and you might have noticed already all of the functions are

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.389 align:start position:0%
noticed already all of the functions are loaded here with their specific

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:18.710 align:start position:0%
loaded here with their specific arguments and the specific types that

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.029 align:start position:0%
arguments and the specific types that these arguments are in. So for example,

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:22.870 align:start position:0%
these arguments are in. So for example, if you're looking here to the hello, it

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
if you're looking here to the hello, it expects an SC string. So it's only

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.470 align:start position:0%
expects an SC string. So it's only accepting strings. So as I'm typing

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.430 align:start position:0%
accepting strings. So as I'm typing here, it's validating the the the input

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.350 align:start position:0%
here, it's validating the the the input that I'm providing. So for example, here

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.750 align:start position:0%
that I'm providing. So for example, here it expects an address for the store. If

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.510 align:start position:0%
it expects an address for the store. If I put anything else other than an

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.669 align:start position:0%
I put anything else other than an address,

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:41.269 align:start position:0%
address, you'll see that it's validating and

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.389 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's validating and telling me, hey, this is not a public

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:44.310 align:start position:0%
telling me, hey, this is not a public key or a contract ID. So it needs to be

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.789 align:start position:0%
key or a contract ID. So it needs to be a valid address. And you should see this

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.470 align:start position:0%
a valid address. And you should see this for all of your functions, all of the

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.630 align:start position:0%
for all of your functions, all of the the known types. So if you go here over

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
the known types. So if you go here over the funible token for example, you see

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.029 align:start position:0%
the funible token for example, you see we have all of these types indicated

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:56.950 align:start position:0%
we have all of these types indicated here along with the fields. So we have

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
here along with the fields. So we have here I 128 and so on. And for functions

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.230 align:start position:0%
here I 128 and so on. And for functions that don't have like arguments don't

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.830 align:start position:0%
that don't have like arguments don't expect arguments you just see this

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
expect arguments you just see this compact version. So you can just check

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.789 align:start position:0%
compact version. So you can just check and simulate like hey is this paused?

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
and simulate like hey is this paused? yes it's not paused returns false.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.470 align:start position:0%
yes it's not paused returns false. Awesome. This is really useful.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.669 align:start position:0%
Awesome. This is really useful. Okay what else? What what else can we

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
Okay what else? What what else can we see here? Let me take a step back and

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
see here? Let me take a step back and see what I took notes. See if I'm not

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
see what I took notes. See if I'm not forgetting anything. Oh, yes. As you're

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.789 align:start position:0%
forgetting anything. Oh, yes. As you're seeing here on top, we have the name of

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:29.029 align:start position:0%
seeing here on top, we have the name of the contract and the contract ID. You

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:30.789 align:start position:0%
the contract and the contract ID. You can just copy it if you're playing

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
can just copy it if you're playing around making direct invocations in the

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
around making direct invocations in the in the CLI, but you can also click here

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.190 align:start position:0%
in the CLI, but you can also click here on show details. And that's very

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
on show details. And that's very interesting. So, what you're seeing here

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.909 align:start position:0%
interesting. So, what you're seeing here is the additional data about this

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:44.230 align:start position:0%
is the additional data about this contract. So here you have the contract

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.789 align:start position:0%
contract. So here you have the contract was hash if you want to play with the

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:49.590 align:start position:0%
was hash if you want to play with the deployed was version. you also have

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.549 align:start position:0%
deployed was version. you also have the contract metadata and if you're not

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.149 align:start position:0%
the contract metadata and if you're not familiar with with what is the contract

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:55.830 align:start position:0%
familiar with with what is the contract metadata you can just come here and

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.310 align:start position:0%
metadata you can just come here and click to see the documentation and read

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.110 align:start position:0%
click to see the documentation and read a little bit more but in essence these

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.029 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but in essence these are some some some some pieces of data

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:05.190 align:start position:0%
are some some some some pieces of data that are automatically embedded into the

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.269 align:start position:0%
that are automatically embedded into the was that included into the the was

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.430 align:start position:0%
was that included into the the was during the compilation but you can also

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.909 align:start position:0%
during the compilation but you can also add your own custom metadata depending

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:15.269 align:start position:0%
add your own custom metadata depending on what you want to send to to the to

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:17.590 align:start position:0%
on what you want to send to to the to the to the deployed version of the

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
the to the deployed version of the contract. So basically what we're doing

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.549 align:start position:0%
contract. So basically what we're doing here is that in this front end once we

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:25.510 align:start position:0%
here is that in this front end once we are going through the the our clients

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
are going through the the our clients and identifying that we have clients for

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.310 align:start position:0%
and identifying that we have clients for these contracts we are also getting

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.470 align:start position:0%
these contracts we are also getting their wasmas getting the was hash

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.029 align:start position:0%
their wasmas getting the was hash getting the wasmas and decoding the

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
getting the wasmas and decoding the was to extract this metadata

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.950 align:start position:0%
was to extract this metadata automatically. So if you connect for

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.590 align:start position:0%
automatically. So if you connect for example this to contract deploying test

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.430 align:start position:0%
example this to contract deploying test net this is also going to work and pull

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.190 align:start position:0%
net this is also going to work and pull all of the metadata related to that

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
all of the metadata related to that contract. Let's just go ahead and make

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.950 align:start position:0%
contract. Let's just go ahead and make some changes and add some metadata to

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.710 align:start position:0%
some changes and add some metadata to this contract. So let's go into this

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.710 align:start position:0%
this contract. So let's go into this hello world contract. It has just the

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.789 align:start position:0%
hello world contract. It has just the basic metadata here indicating the

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:56.950 align:start position:0%
basic metadata here indicating the version, the SDK version, the protocol

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
version, the SDK version, the protocol version and release. So I'll just go

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.110 align:start position:0%
version and release. So I'll just go ahead and there are a few ways in which

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.230 align:start position:0%
ahead and there are a few ways in which you can do this. One that is very simple

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
you can do this. One that is very simple is directly through the tommo file. So

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.669 align:start position:0%
is directly through the tommo file. So I'll just copy here and go to the tommo

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:12.389 align:start position:0%
I'll just copy here and go to the tommo file and I'll add this section here for

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:14.789 align:start position:0%
file and I'll add this section here for package metadata.stellar.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:18.149 align:start position:0%
package metadata.stellar. And we have some some some some

00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:20.149 align:start position:0%
And we have some some some some different properties here basically

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:22.230 align:start position:0%
different properties here basically indicating this is a contract. I have

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.070 align:start position:0%
indicating this is a contract. I have some custom ones like I have my custom

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.310 align:start position:0%
some custom ones like I have my custom string fu my custom boot through. We

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.549 align:start position:0%
string fu my custom boot through. We have authors we have the repository the

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.630 align:start position:0%
have authors we have the repository the homepage and all of these are going to

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.070 align:start position:0%
homepage and all of these are going to be baked into the contract during the

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.669 align:start position:0%
be baked into the contract during the build. You can also beyond this you can

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
build. You can also beyond this you can also come here and this is something you

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.909 align:start position:0%
also come here and this is something you can do in your own contracts which is to

00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
can do in your own contracts which is to use the macro contract contract

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.430 align:start position:0%
use the macro contract contract matter there you go let me just make

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.669 align:start position:0%
matter there you go let me just make sure it's imported and for contract

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.909 align:start position:0%
sure it's imported and for contract matter all you need to do is to form a

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
matter all you need to do is to form a key which I'll just say my

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.110 align:start position:0%
key which I'll just say my my key that's more than enough and a

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
my key that's more than enough and a value so for the value I'll just call

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.190 align:start position:0%
value so for the value I'll just call I'll just say fifu

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.190 align:start position:0%
I'll just say fifu oh yeah there we go. Let me just save

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.350 align:start position:0%
oh yeah there we go. Let me just save it will also rerun everything. So let's

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.470 align:start position:0%
it will also rerun everything. So let's just wait a little bit and as it's doing

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.149 align:start position:0%
just wait a little bit and as it's doing basically everything is going to be

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.909 align:start position:0%
basically everything is going to be included into the was during the

00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
included into the was during the compilation and once we load it in the

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.470 align:start position:0%
compilation and once we load it in the front end we are going to decode from

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
front end we are going to decode from the wasp and and and present it show in

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.789 align:start position:0%
the wasp and and and present it show in the front end. So I think everything has

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
the front end. So I think everything has run here. Let me just go and there you

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.029 align:start position:0%
run here. Let me just go and there you go. You see we have a bunch of new stuff

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:33.190 align:start position:0%
go. You see we have a bunch of new stuff popping up now. So all the keys that I

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.430 align:start position:0%
popping up now. So all the keys that I have included through the tommo plus the

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
have included through the tommo plus the key I included here. So let me just see

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.149 align:start position:0%
key I included here. So let me just see my key foil here on top is of type meta

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:41.990 align:start position:0%
my key foil here on top is of type meta entry. We have the other traditional

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
entry. We have the other traditional ones. We have the outs that came from

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:46.549 align:start position:0%
ones. We have the outs that came from the tommo. We have contract true the

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:49.509 align:start position:0%
the tommo. We have contract true the home domain and so on. So that's very

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:51.029 align:start position:0%
home domain and so on. So that's very powerful and if you want to reuse this

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:52.870 align:start position:0%
powerful and if you want to reuse this in your project you can just grab these

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.630 align:start position:0%
in your project you can just grab these components and reusing the front end

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.630 align:start position:0%
components and reusing the front end app. And in the same way way something

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.630 align:start position:0%
app. And in the same way way something that we we were conscious about here is

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.990 align:start position:0%
that we we were conscious about here is that all of this contract explorer

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.230 align:start position:0%
that all of this contract explorer capability and and functionality is not

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
capability and and functionality is not something that you want to ship to your

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.310 align:start position:0%
something that you want to ship to your production environment for example. So

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.389 align:start position:0%
production environment for example. So everything that you see related to this

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:14.950 align:start position:0%
everything that you see related to this page is tightly organized within the

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
page is tightly organized within the debug directory. So you can easily just

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.109 align:start position:0%
debug directory. So you can easily just delete this this debug directory and

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:21.030 align:start position:0%
delete this this debug directory and extract everything and you'll be have a

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.030 align:start position:0%
extract everything and you'll be have a clean project. And also if you want to

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.790 align:start position:0%
clean project. And also if you want to just reuse some bits, you can just go

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.950 align:start position:0%
just reuse some bits, you can just go select the components and reuse those in

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.389 align:start position:0%
select the components and reuse those in your project. So moving forward, okay,

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:33.510 align:start position:0%
your project. So moving forward, okay, we made some changes. I updated the

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.829 align:start position:0%
we made some changes. I updated the metadata. What else can we do? So you

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:39.030 align:start position:0%
metadata. What else can we do? So you remember I was telling you about the

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.310 align:start position:0%
remember I was telling you about the environments and let me just go ahead

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.589 align:start position:0%
environments and let me just go ahead here and find the file environments.

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
here and find the file environments. which is the file that allows us to make

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.310 align:start position:0%
which is the file that allows us to make some configuration about the

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.629 align:start position:0%
some configuration about the environment we're working on. So I'll

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.310 align:start position:0%
environment we're working on. So I'll just go ahead here and have a look at

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.869 align:start position:0%
just go ahead here and have a look at the NFT one. And for the NFT one, we see

00:34:56.879 --> 00:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
the NFT one. And for the NFT one, we see that all it has said is we have we want

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
that all it has said is we have we want to we want to build clients for this

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.950 align:start position:0%
to we want to build clients for this contract and we also are constructing

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.829 align:start position:0%
contract and we also are constructing this with me the MI account as the

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:12.069 align:start position:0%
this with me the MI account as the owner. So what if we also wanna let's

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:16.069 align:start position:0%
owner. So what if we also wanna let's say men some some units of it. So let me

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
say men some some units of it. So let me go ahead and grab this which is the

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.150 align:start position:0%
go ahead and grab this which is the example we have here and I basically am

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.030 align:start position:0%
example we have here and I basically am going to add a after deploy and here we

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.030 align:start position:0%
going to add a after deploy and here we can just chain different commands we

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.910 align:start position:0%
can just chain different commands we want to run after the deploy. So here in

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.310 align:start position:0%
want to run after the deploy. So here in this example I'll just going go around

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.630 align:start position:0%
this example I'll just going go around and but let me see what is the actual

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.750 align:start position:0%
and but let me see what is the actual syntax for this contract. NFT

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.510 align:start position:0%
syntax for this contract. NFT innumerable

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.630 align:start position:0%
innumerable contract and the constructor. Okay,

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.349 align:start position:0%
contract and the constructor. Okay, so it's a nouner and it's an address. So

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
so it's a nouner and it's an address. So that's where sorry not the constructor,

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:50.230 align:start position:0%
that's where sorry not the constructor, the mint. So it's two and an address.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.750 align:start position:0%
the mint. So it's two and an address. There we go. Let me go to the

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.910 align:start position:0%
There we go. Let me go to the environments. So mint two and then an

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
environments. So mint two and then an address. I'll just delete this. I just

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
address. I'll just delete this. I just give the name of the the address and

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.430 align:start position:0%
give the name of the the address and there you go. It should be able as I

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.870 align:start position:0%
there you go. It should be able as I make new deployments, it should be able

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.829 align:start position:0%
make new deployments, it should be able to do it. Now, even though it's running,

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:09.670 align:start position:0%
to do it. Now, even though it's running, I didn't change anything in the

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.069 align:start position:0%
I didn't change anything in the contract. So, it's not going to identify

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
contract. So, it's not going to identify changes in the was. So, it's not going

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
changes in the was. So, it's not going to deploy a new was for me. So, I'll

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.069 align:start position:0%
to deploy a new was for me. So, I'll just go ahead and make a change to this

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and make a change to this contract. So, one thing that we can take

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.190 align:start position:0%
contract. So, one thing that we can take advantage of this update and I already

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.430 align:start position:0%
advantage of this update and I already highlighted that we can also add rest

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.069 align:start position:0%
highlighted that we can also add rest docs here as comments. So for example we

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
docs here as comments. So for example we can say that this no it doesn't

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.150 align:start position:0%
can say that this no it doesn't returns the owner the contract no

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.349 align:start position:0%
returns the owner the contract no copilot this is a mint a new token to

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:37.990 align:start position:0%
copilot this is a mint a new token to specified address color must be and so

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.589 align:start position:0%
specified address color must be and so on okay this is good enough let me just

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:44.069 align:start position:0%
on okay this is good enough let me just leave these two lines so once we have

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
leave these two lines so once we have these docs on top of the functions

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.790 align:start position:0%
these docs on top of the functions and we save these are going to be

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.190 align:start position:0%
and we save these are going to be included in the w and in the spec of the

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
included in the w and in the spec of the contract. So when we are loading the

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.430 align:start position:0%
contract. So when we are loading the front end, we are going to identify this

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.109 align:start position:0%
front end, we are going to identify this and show those alongside with the

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
and show those alongside with the functions. So let's just wait a second.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
functions. So let's just wait a second. It's running everything. You should be

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
It's running everything. You should be seeing this sometimes blinking a little

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
seeing this sometimes blinking a little bit. This means that there's a lot of

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
bit. This means that there's a lot of stuff going on and the the vit is

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.430 align:start position:0%
stuff going on and the the vit is watching for these changes and just

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
watching for these changes and just updating everything. So running. I'll

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.630 align:start position:0%
updating everything. So running. I'll just for let me just double check.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.310 align:start position:0%
just for let me just double check. I think everything executed. Let me just

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.310 align:start position:0%
I think everything executed. Let me just have a look. it's the enumerable.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.109 align:start position:0%
have a look. it's the enumerable. Let me just see if Oh yeah, got to have

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
Let me just see if Oh yeah, got to have a look why it didn't just up there

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
a look why it didn't just up there automatically. But there it is. I put

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.109 align:start position:0%
automatically. But there it is. I put it into into lines. This is very small.

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.710 align:start position:0%
it into into lines. This is very small. It should expand a little bit further.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
It should expand a little bit further. So a lot of stuff to take notes as

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.230 align:start position:0%
So a lot of stuff to take notes as improvements, but basically it brings

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.990 align:start position:0%
improvements, but basically it brings the the rust doc here. We have some

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.589 align:start position:0%
the the rust doc here. We have some indications and it's going to always

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
indications and it's going to always show up with the the functions that that

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.870 align:start position:0%
show up with the the functions that that they are attached to. So, okay, I added

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.069 align:start position:0%
they are attached to. So, okay, I added the step to mint and and and already

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
the step to mint and and and already send that to the address which is what

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.630 align:start position:0%
send that to the address which is what is the name of the address? Me. So, let

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
is the name of the address? Me. So, let me go ahead and get this address. What

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.349 align:start position:0%
me go ahead and get this address. What is the key? So, stellar keys public

00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:09.430 align:start position:0%
is the key? So, stellar keys public key me. No, isn't that Oh, I added a a K

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.550 align:start position:0%
key me. No, isn't that Oh, I added a a K and again a typo. Oh, yeah, but it

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.390 align:start position:0%
and again a typo. Oh, yeah, but it worked. So, this is the MI account. So

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.310 align:start position:0%
worked. So, this is the MI account. So let me check if it has a balance.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.109 align:start position:0%
let me check if it has a balance. Simulate. There you go. We see read

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
Simulate. There you go. We see read successful. Let me check the balance.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.550 align:start position:0%
successful. Let me check the balance. And it has. Here it is. Return value. It

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.829 align:start position:0%
And it has. Here it is. Return value. It has. It has a balance of one one NFT. So

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:31.910 align:start position:0%
has. It has a balance of one one NFT. So if I check I think we have another

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.710 align:start position:0%
if I check I think we have another function here owner off and the token

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
function here owner off and the token ID. So we know that this is the

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.710 align:start position:0%
ID. So we know that this is the sequential token. So the token number

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.190 align:start position:0%
sequential token. So the token number zero will be the first one. Yes, I can

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.790 align:start position:0%
zero will be the first one. Yes, I can simulate and see that the owner

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.950 align:start position:0%
simulate and see that the owner is the address of my admin. Some other

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.630 align:start position:0%
is the address of my admin. Some other stuff you could be doing and it's very

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
stuff you could be doing and it's very helpful here. So, I use this key, but

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
helpful here. So, I use this key, but sometimes I don't have those in my my

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.950 align:start position:0%
sometimes I don't have those in my my wallets. So, you can use stellar keys to

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.670 align:start position:0%
wallets. So, you can use stellar keys to also grab the private keys and import

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.390 align:start position:0%
also grab the private keys and import in your wallets if you want to run some

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.069 align:start position:0%
in your wallets if you want to run some functions for example from the admin

00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
functions for example from the admin perspective. So I'll go with stellar

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.109 align:start position:0%
perspective. So I'll go with stellar keys secret if I'm not mistaken me.

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.030 align:start position:0%
keys secret if I'm not mistaken me. There you go. That's the secret of the

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.589 align:start position:0%
There you go. That's the secret of the MI account. So I'll just go ahead and

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
MI account. So I'll just go ahead and freighter.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.190 align:start position:0%
freighter. And for freighter we have here you click

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.950 align:start position:0%
And for freighter we have here you click on this icon on top. You see your

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.470 align:start position:0%
on this icon on top. You see your accounts and you can easily click on

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.670 align:start position:0%
accounts and you can easily click on import secret key. I just paste it. And

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.510 align:start position:0%
import secret key. I just paste it. And remember if you're seeing the secret key

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.190 align:start position:0%
remember if you're seeing the secret key publicly in this recording you should be

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.150 align:start position:0%
publicly in this recording you should be using this for real because this has

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.150 align:start position:0%
using this for real because this has been exposed. Let me just put my

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.390 align:start position:0%
been exposed. Let me just put my password. And don't forget to click on

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.310 align:start position:0%
password. And don't forget to click on this checkbox and I'll just import it.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.829 align:start position:0%
this checkbox and I'll just import it. There you go. AM2 I. Yes, that's

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:45.670 align:start position:0%
There you go. AM2 I. Yes, that's correct. That's the account. All right.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.750 align:start position:0%
correct. That's the account. All right. So, I'm connected with my admin now. So,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.589 align:start position:0%
So, I'm connected with my admin now. So, if I want to play around and I want to

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:51.910 align:start position:0%
if I want to play around and I want to make transactions or means from the

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
make transactions or means from the perspective of the owner, I can do that.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
perspective of the owner, I can do that. So, I just go ahead for example, grab

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
So, I just go ahead for example, grab the address of a different one which is

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.710 align:start position:0%
the address of a different one which is my FIFO account. I'll just come here,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.910 align:start position:0%
my FIFO account. I'll just come here, copy, and again switch to my admin,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.030 align:start position:0%
copy, and again switch to my admin, which is this one. And let me mint a

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.829 align:start position:0%
which is this one. And let me mint a token to my FIFO account. There we go.

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:11.430 align:start position:0%
token to my FIFO account. There we go. And one important thing here, you notice

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.190 align:start position:0%
And one important thing here, you notice that right away I can click on submit.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.670 align:start position:0%
that right away I can click on submit. You don't have to manually simulate. You

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
You don't have to manually simulate. You can always simulate to see beforehand

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
can always simulate to see beforehand what will be the the outcome if it is

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.990 align:start position:0%
what will be the the outcome if it is likely to fail or not. But you can just

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.910 align:start position:0%
likely to fail or not. But you can just come here and directly click on submit

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.230 align:start position:0%
come here and directly click on submit and it's going to run the whole

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
and it's going to run the whole workflow. So it's going to configure the

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.670 align:start position:0%
workflow. So it's going to configure the transaction, simulate it, check the

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.950 align:start position:0%
transaction, simulate it, check the result, prepare the transaction, sign,

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.589 align:start position:0%
result, prepare the transaction, sign, and then submit. So I will just click on

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:41.430 align:start position:0%
and then submit. So I will just click on submit. You'll be prompted to to to

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
submit. You'll be prompted to to to reveal and sign, approve and continue.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.589 align:start position:0%
reveal and sign, approve and continue. Yes, that's correct. Sign transaction.

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:50.470 align:start position:0%
Yes, that's correct. Sign transaction. And there you go. It was successfully

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.630 align:start position:0%
And there you go. It was successfully executed. So, if I grab my FIFO account

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.829 align:start position:0%
executed. So, if I grab my FIFO account here now and check for the balance

00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:58.630 align:start position:0%
here now and check for the balance and simulate, I should be able to see

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.589 align:start position:0%
and simulate, I should be able to see that it holds a token. Oops. Oops. Too

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
that it holds a token. Oops. Oops. Too much scroll. There you go. Return value

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.710 align:start position:0%
much scroll. There you go. Return value number one. It means it's hold holding

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
number one. It means it's hold holding one NFD. And if I check for the owner of

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.910 align:start position:0%
one NFD. And if I check for the owner of the number one,

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.030 align:start position:0%
the number one, let me see. Show details. Who is owning

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.990 align:start position:0%
let me see. Show details. Who is owning the NFT number one? There you go. The

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.190 align:start position:0%
the NFT number one? There you go. The FIFA account. Awesome. Awesome. Okay,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.710 align:start position:0%
FIFA account. Awesome. Awesome. Okay, Fifo, but you're just showing the

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.630 align:start position:0%
Fifo, but you're just showing the examples we have here. You just made

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.710 align:start position:0%
examples we have here. You just made small tweaks. What else can we do? What

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.950 align:start position:0%
small tweaks. What else can we do? What else is in there for us? So, another

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
else is in there for us? So, another nice thing that I want to show here

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
nice thing that I want to show here today is the generate. So, if you go to

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.109 align:start position:0%
today is the generate. So, if you go to let me just close let me stop this for a

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:38.950 align:start position:0%
let me just close let me stop this for a while and close this one so you guys can

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.550 align:start position:0%
while and close this one so you guys can see this. , let me just go to stellar

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.069 align:start position:0%
see this. , let me just go to stellar scaffold

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:45.829 align:start position:0%
scaffold again. Show the commands. These are the

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:47.829 align:start position:0%
again. Show the commands. These are the commands we have. I want to show you the

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:51.030 align:start position:0%
commands we have. I want to show you the generate one. So the generate one is to

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.710 align:start position:0%
generate one. So the generate one is to generate new contracts in this

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
generate new contracts in this repository. So let me go ahead stellar

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.270 align:start position:0%
repository. So let me go ahead stellar scaffold generate and let me see the

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.069 align:start position:0%
scaffold generate and let me see the options we have here. So basically

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:02.790 align:start position:0%
options we have here. So basically sorry I I can generate contracts. So

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.470 align:start position:0%
sorry I I can generate contracts. So generate contract h and there you go. So

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.309 align:start position:0%
generate contract h and there you go. So the options I have here I can clone one

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:12.470 align:start position:0%
the options I have here I can clone one of the examples existing in the open

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.790 align:start position:0%
of the examples existing in the open zapping repository. And if you're not

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.109 align:start position:0%
zapping repository. And if you're not familiar let me just make sure I have it

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:20.309 align:start position:0%
familiar let me just make sure I have it here. this is the repository. It's

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
here. this is the repository. It's managed by open zapling. They have some

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.910 align:start position:0%
managed by open zapling. They have some very nice examples over here that you

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.589 align:start position:0%
very nice examples over here that you can have a look. So basically you can

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
can have a look. So basically you can choose any one of those and directly

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.790 align:start position:0%
choose any one of those and directly clone into the to the repository. you

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
clone into the to the repository. you also have the option to list the

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:33.750 align:start position:0%
also have the option to list the existing ones which will show the list

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.510 align:start position:0%
existing ones which will show the list of the ones in the examples. You can

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.510 align:start position:0%
of the ones in the examples. You can also go to the wizard. So it's going to

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
also go to the wizard. So it's going to pop up. Let me show you. If you hit

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.750 align:start position:0%
pop up. Let me show you. If you hit contract,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.430 align:start position:0%
contract, oops,

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.710 align:start position:0%
oops, from wizard,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.630 align:start position:0%
from wizard, it pops up the wizard from open zap

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.550 align:start position:0%
it pops up the wizard from open zap link. So, this is a really nice wizard

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.630 align:start position:0%
link. So, this is a really nice wizard that allows you to combine different

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.790 align:start position:0%
that allows you to combine different features. So, I want to make a token

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.589 align:start position:0%
features. So, I want to make a token that is mintable and it's burnable and

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
that is mintable and it's burnable and pausible. So, it adds all of these

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.670 align:start position:0%
pausible. So, it adds all of these characteristics and all the markers and

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.430 align:start position:0%
characteristics and all the markers and you can just grab it and bring to your

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
you can just grab it and bring to your project. But what I'll be doing here is

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.870 align:start position:0%
project. But what I'll be doing here is basically using the other option which

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:14.470 align:start position:0%
basically using the other option which is I'll go contract ls. Oh sorry it's a

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.510 align:start position:0%
is I'll go contract ls. Oh sorry it's a ls and here I can see all the available

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.910 align:start position:0%
ls and here I can see all the available contracts in the open z. So I'll go

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.630 align:start position:0%
contracts in the open z. So I'll go ahead and copy one. Let me see. I'll get

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
ahead and copy one. Let me see. I'll get let's let's use the funible cap if I'm

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.109 align:start position:0%
let's let's use the funible cap if I'm not mistaken. I think that's a good one.

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:30.710 align:start position:0%
not mistaken. I think that's a good one. Let me just again check it's from. Okay.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.910 align:start position:0%
Let me just again check it's from. Okay. So I'll use from. So stylish scaffold

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.309 align:start position:0%
So I'll use from. So stylish scaffold generate contract from and I'll add it's

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:42.230 align:start position:0%
generate contract from and I'll add it's fun how do you write it? Funible cap.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.309 align:start position:0%
fun how do you write it? Funible cap. Funible

00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
Funible funible

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.670 align:start position:0%
funible cap. Is that correct? I hope so. Yes.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
cap. Is that correct? I hope so. Yes. let me see. Yes. We have a new contract

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.750 align:start position:0%
let me see. Yes. We have a new contract here. So if you look here we have the

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.309 align:start position:0%
here. So if you look here we have the contract funible cat. It was it was

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:01.190 align:start position:0%
contract funible cat. It was it was imported in our repository. So let me go

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.990 align:start position:0%
imported in our repository. So let me go ahead and also add it to our add it to

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.829 align:start position:0%
ahead and also add it to our add it to our configuration. So it can be built

00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:07.510 align:start position:0%
our configuration. So it can be built and then we can generate a client and so

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.190 align:start position:0%
and then we can generate a client and so on. And let me have a look. Does it have

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.190 align:start position:0%
on. And let me have a look. Does it have a constructor? Yes, it has a constructor

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
a constructor? Yes, it has a constructor and expects a cap interfere. So let's go

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.309 align:start position:0%
and expects a cap interfere. So let's go to our do we have it open? No. Where is

00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:21.109 align:start position:0%
to our do we have it open? No. Where is it? Environments.

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
it? Environments. I'll go ahead and add a new contract. So

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and add a new contract. So I'll use the same syntax we did for the

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.069 align:start position:0%
I'll use the same syntax we did for the token for the fun token. I'll just

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:32.309 align:start position:0%
token for the fun token. I'll just copy this. let me put it at the end.

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:35.109 align:start position:0%
copy this. let me put it at the end. So I'll have a new one. And this one is

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:37.990 align:start position:0%
So I'll have a new one. And this one is funo

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
funo kept. It's important that it matches the

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.430 align:start position:0%
kept. It's important that it matches the name. Let me see how it's set in the

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.109 align:start position:0%
name. Let me see how it's set in the tunnel.

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
tunnel. where is the tunnel? There you go.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.470 align:start position:0%
where is the tunnel? There you go. Example. So it's fun cap example. Yes.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.829 align:start position:0%
Example. So it's fun cap example. Yes. But it needs to match the the final

00:44:53.839 --> 00:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
But it needs to match the the final file generated. So it should have the

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.150 align:start position:0%
file generated. So it should have the underscore. So, French ball cap example.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.550 align:start position:0%
underscore. So, French ball cap example. There we go. Client true. And we also

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.630 align:start position:0%
There we go. Client true. And we also want to

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
want to invoke the constructor right afterwards,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
invoke the constructor right afterwards, but it accepts a cap argument with an

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.030 align:start position:0%
but it accepts a cap argument with an integer. So, I'll just say the cap is

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.069 align:start position:0%
integer. So, I'll just say the cap is 10,000. Just an arbitrary number. And

00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:18.790 align:start position:0%
10,000. Just an arbitrary number. And let's save. Let me see. Oh, sorry. I had

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.550 align:start position:0%
let's save. Let me see. Oh, sorry. I had stopped the command here. So, npm

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.950 align:start position:0%
stopped the command here. So, npm rundev.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.710 align:start position:0%
rundev. Let's see if it identifies the changes

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.630 align:start position:0%
Let's see if it identifies the changes right away and and runs it.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.309 align:start position:0%
It's running everything. Let me go back here to see. There we go. But I think it

00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:37.109 align:start position:0%
here to see. There we go. But I think it didn't deploy it yet. Let's wait a

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:40.069 align:start position:0%
didn't deploy it yet. Let's wait a little bit. Is it running? Let me see

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:41.910 align:start position:0%
little bit. Is it running? Let me see this teller.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.470 align:start position:0%
this teller. Hello. And so on. No, I think it's

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.710 align:start position:0%
Hello. And so on. No, I think it's stopped. So, I should have run the

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.670 align:start position:0%
stopped. So, I should have run the command before I updated it. Let's just

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.069 align:start position:0%
command before I updated it. Let's just make a a small change so it detects the

00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:55.750 align:start position:0%
make a a small change so it detects the change. I'll just add some comments

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.390 align:start position:0%
change. I'll just add some comments here. Maybe on this one. Oh, no. It's

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
here. Maybe on this one. Oh, no. It's still running. Sorry. There you go.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.910 align:start position:0%
still running. Sorry. There you go. Still running. Still running.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.670 align:start position:0%
Still running. Still running. Everything updated.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.829 align:start position:0%
Blinking for a while. Don't worry. This happens sometimes as we are removing and

00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
happens sometimes as we are removing and adding packages. Let me just double

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.470 align:start position:0%
adding packages. Let me just double check if this is because we added a new

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
check if this is because we added a new package that not was not tracked. I

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.309 align:start position:0%
package that not was not tracked. I know there is an open issue that the

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
know there is an open issue that the team is working was working today around

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.030 align:start position:0%
team is working was working today around how we are tracking the newly generated

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
how we are tracking the newly generated packages. So sometimes we add a new

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
packages. So sometimes we add a new package and it might not identify in the

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
package and it might not identify in the workspace. So we can so we just run the

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.270 align:start position:0%
workspace. So we can so we just run the npmi here at the root level and it will

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.829 align:start position:0%
npmi here at the root level and it will identify. This is a quick workaround but

00:46:37.839 --> 00:46:40.630 align:start position:0%
identify. This is a quick workaround but I know there they're patching it as we

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.470 align:start position:0%
I know there they're patching it as we are presenting this. And there you go.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.990 align:start position:0%
are presenting this. And there you go. That was it. it's loading everything.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
That was it. it's loading everything. There you go. We see a new one here.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.309 align:start position:0%
There you go. We see a new one here. Funible cap example we have our token

00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
Funible cap example we have our token it does it have an admin let me just

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
it does it have an admin let me just double check no it doesn't have an admin

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
double check no it doesn't have an admin so that means that I can just m with any

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.910 align:start position:0%
so that means that I can just m with any account so let me check the total

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.069 align:start position:0%
account so let me check the total supply before we start invoking this

00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:05.270 align:start position:0%
supply before we start invoking this contract and the total supply is indeed

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.069 align:start position:0%
contract and the total supply is indeed zero so there are no units in existence

00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:10.870 align:start position:0%
zero so there are no units in existence or running around so let's go ahead and

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.790 align:start position:0%
or running around so let's go ahead and mint some so I'll just mint to the to

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.309 align:start position:0%
mint some so I'll just mint to the to our admin or to our main account

00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:21.829 align:start position:0%
our admin or to our main account directly and you open here. Copy.

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.150 align:start position:0%
directly and you open here. Copy. Let's just use this one amount. Let's

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.670 align:start position:0%
Let's just use this one amount. Let's just use a normal amount that's under

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.829 align:start position:0%
just use a normal amount that's under the cap. So, this one should be okay

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
the cap. So, this one should be okay because it's under the cap.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.190 align:start position:0%
because it's under the cap. Loading. There we go. Execute it. Submit

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.870 align:start position:0%
Loading. There we go. Execute it. Submit it. If I get this account and check the

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.870 align:start position:0%
it. If I get this account and check the balance, simulate. Show details. And I

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
balance, simulate. Show details. And I run down here. 5,000. So, the balance is

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.150 align:start position:0%
run down here. 5,000. So, the balance is there. it was minted. So, let's go ahead

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.990 align:start position:0%
there. it was minted. So, let's go ahead and try to mint 50,01.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.069 align:start position:0%
and try to mint 50,01. And this now shouldn't go ahead. So, if

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:56.710 align:start position:0%
And this now shouldn't go ahead. So, if I click both simulator submit, it fails

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.030 align:start position:0%
I click both simulator submit, it fails because the simulation fails because we

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
because the simulation fails because we are hitting the cap. So, we should be

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.190 align:start position:0%
are hitting the cap. So, we should be able to see here the details of the

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
able to see here the details of the failed simulation and what happened. So

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.190 align:start position:0%
failed simulation and what happened. So as you see we just added a new contract

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
as you see we just added a new contract started playing around and you see

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.309 align:start position:0%
started playing around and you see things gives us a lot of speed because

00:48:12.319 --> 00:48:14.390 align:start position:0%
things gives us a lot of speed because you can just start invoking everything

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.069 align:start position:0%
you can just start invoking everything from the client and seeing the changes

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:18.069 align:start position:0%
from the client and seeing the changes right away. So I think this is very

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:20.069 align:start position:0%
right away. So I think this is very powerful and should be very helpful for

00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:22.069 align:start position:0%
powerful and should be very helpful for new developers coming getting up to

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
new developers coming getting up to speed and seeing how the implementation

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.390 align:start position:0%
speed and seeing how the implementation is managing all these workflows and you

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.510 align:start position:0%
is managing all these workflows and you should be seeing some improvements

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
should be seeing some improvements coming soon as we gather feedback and

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.829 align:start position:0%
coming soon as we gather feedback and start adding more functionality to it.

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:33.589 align:start position:0%
start adding more functionality to it. So, I'll pause for a second and take a

00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:36.470 align:start position:0%
So, I'll pause for a second and take a sip of water just to to lubricate my my

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.390 align:start position:0%
sip of water just to to lubricate my my vocal cords. And Carson, I'm not sure if

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.950 align:start position:0%
vocal cords. And Carson, I'm not sure if we have any questions or if like to open

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.150 align:start position:0%
we have any questions or if like to open up for anyone.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.470 align:start position:0%
up for anyone. &gt;&gt; I I think we pretty much caught up

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I I think we pretty much caught up questions, but if anyone has

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.549 align:start position:0%
questions, but if anyone has questions, please feel free to to ask.

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:51.589 align:start position:0%
questions, please feel free to to ask. I think this this is a really this is

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:54.950 align:start position:0%
I think this this is a really this is a really great demo that shows how much

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
a really great demo that shows how much progress you've made on this. I love

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
progress you've made on this. I love that the tooling is built in. It makes

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
that the tooling is built in. It makes it super easy to debug and to develop

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.390 align:start position:0%
it super easy to debug and to develop and add on to your smart contracts.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.630 align:start position:0%
and add on to your smart contracts. you don't need to have a ton of tooling

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.790 align:start position:0%
you don't need to have a ton of tooling set up. it's all built in. It makes

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.710 align:start position:0%
set up. it's all built in. It makes it very very easy. So yeah, I I I

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
it very very easy. So yeah, I I I downloaded the and ran the the latest

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.190 align:start position:0%
downloaded the and ran the the latest that's at least the public one last

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.510 align:start position:0%
that's at least the public one last night and it was super easy to get up

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
night and it was super easy to get up and running as as soon as I I figured

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.190 align:start position:0%
and running as as soon as I I figured out that I needed to have my my Docker

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.069 align:start position:0%
out that I needed to have my my Docker running. I didn't have that. It

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:32.710 align:start position:0%
running. I didn't have that. It was on pause. So after that

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.950 align:start position:0%
was on pause. So after that everything was pretty smooth and and I

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.990 align:start position:0%
everything was pretty smooth and and I and and there was there was a comment

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
and and there was there was a comment about about Stella Lab you can

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.950 align:start position:0%
about about Stella Lab you can actually connect Stella Lab to quick

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.390 align:start position:0%
actually connect Stella Lab to quick start that works even if you have

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
start that works even if you have quick start and you have this running on

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.470 align:start position:0%
quick start and you have this running on your local machine you can still use

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.630 align:start position:0%
your local machine you can still use the web-based stellar lab but but I

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.549 align:start position:0%
the web-based stellar lab but but I think most of the functionality that

00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:58.549 align:start position:0%
think most of the functionality that that that I would be interested in you

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.710 align:start position:0%
that that I would be interested in you already exposed those here like the

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.309 align:start position:0%
already exposed those here like the smart contracts, you can invoke them and

00:50:02.319 --> 00:50:04.950 align:start position:0%
smart contracts, you can invoke them and you can see the output. So most of the

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
you can see the output. So most of the functionality I use in cell lab is is

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.430 align:start position:0%
functionality I use in cell lab is is already included in in this in this

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
already included in in this in this version. So yeah, amazing amazing job.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.829 align:start position:0%
version. So yeah, amazing amazing job. &gt;&gt; Awesome. It's great to hear that and I

00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:18.069 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Awesome. It's great to hear that and I invite everyone to play around, test,

00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:19.750 align:start position:0%
invite everyone to play around, test, share the feedback, especially people

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.109 align:start position:0%
share the feedback, especially people participating in the hackathons. Like

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:22.790 align:start position:0%
participating in the hackathons. Like this is a great starter for the

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.150 align:start position:0%
this is a great starter for the hackathons. They can really get up to

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.589 align:start position:0%
hackathons. They can really get up to speed.

00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
speed. Yeah, I think for hack meridian,

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.750 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I think for hack meridian, we definitely need to do a big push to

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.430 align:start position:0%
we definitely need to do a big push to get people going on this. I we always

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.190 align:start position:0%
get people going on this. I we always see when we do hackathons, we always see

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.349 align:start position:0%
see when we do hackathons, we always see some struggle a little bit setting up

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:40.790 align:start position:0%
some struggle a little bit setting up their environment, get everything

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.790 align:start position:0%
their environment, get everything installed and sometimes they maybe spend

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.950 align:start position:0%
installed and sometimes they maybe spend an hour getting things up and running

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.990 align:start position:0%
an hour getting things up and running instead of starting to code or to decide

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.190 align:start position:0%
instead of starting to code or to decide what to build. So this is really a fast

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.150 align:start position:0%
what to build. So this is really a fast track to to get started working on

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.030 align:start position:0%
track to to get started working on your project and and start coding.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.630 align:start position:0%
your project and and start coding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and we have some hidden gems

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.309 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and we have some hidden gems that I didn't even touch here because of

00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:03.190 align:start position:0%
that I didn't even touch here because of the time. But if I I I really suggest

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.950 align:start position:0%
the time. But if I I I really suggest you guys have a look. For example, we

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.470 align:start position:0%
you guys have a look. For example, we have some hooks that allow you to

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.870 align:start position:0%
have some hooks that allow you to directly listen for specific events. So

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.990 align:start position:0%
directly listen for specific events. So if you're playing with events and

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.910 align:start position:0%
if you're playing with events and meeting events in your contract, you can

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.510 align:start position:0%
meeting events in your contract, you can already in your front end start

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.109 align:start position:0%
already in your front end start listening for those and reacting

00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
listening for those and reacting automatically. So you could make some

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
automatically. So you could make some fancy stuff here. I think this could be

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.589 align:start position:0%
fancy stuff here. I think this could be a next step for this explorer to have

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
a next step for this explorer to have some options to already list and see the

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.829 align:start position:0%
some options to already list and see the events coming up as you're making the

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:27.430 align:start position:0%
events coming up as you're making the invocations. But this could be very

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.309 align:start position:0%
invocations. But this could be very powerful.

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:31.589 align:start position:0%
powerful. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great.

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:33.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Great. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. If you guys find

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.349 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Awesome. If you guys find anything or have any any feedback, feel

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:37.190 align:start position:0%
anything or have any any feedback, feel free to share directly in the repository

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.349 align:start position:0%
free to share directly in the repository or get get in touch with us.

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:41.270 align:start position:0%
or get get in touch with us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How is the best way? Let's say I

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How is the best way? Let's say I find a bug or something is not working.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.829 align:start position:0%
find a bug or something is not working. What is the best way to to to let you

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:47.030 align:start position:0%
What is the best way to to to let you guys know?

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
guys know? &gt;&gt; I I encourage everyone to directly open

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I I encourage everyone to directly open a niche on the repository because we are

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.630 align:start position:0%
a niche on the repository because we are definitely looking there every day. It

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
definitely looking there every day. It will be the quickest way, but we're also

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.870 align:start position:0%
will be the quickest way, but we're also on Discord. So on the developer Discord,

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.470 align:start position:0%
on Discord. So on the developer Discord, the developer community, we're always

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.030 align:start position:0%
the developer community, we're always there. So feel free to just tag us, me

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.670 align:start position:0%
there. So feel free to just tag us, me or the team. We're always looking there.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.190 align:start position:0%
or the team. We're always looking there. &gt;&gt; Great.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.349 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Great. Okay. If there's no other questions,

00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:09.910 align:start position:0%
Okay. If there's no other questions, I would like to thank you so much for

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.589 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank you so much for giving this demo. This was a very

00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:14.309 align:start position:0%
giving this demo. This was a very extensive demo. you really took us far

00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:17.589 align:start position:0%
extensive demo. you really took us far into into the scaffold stellar and it

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:20.790 align:start position:0%
into into the scaffold stellar and it was really great. so yeah, thank you

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
was really great. so yeah, thank you so much and I think we will probably do

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.390 align:start position:0%
so much and I think we will probably do another update at a later time but

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.470 align:start position:0%
another update at a later time but until then I I would encourage everyone

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.150 align:start position:0%
until then I I would encourage everyone who builds on Stella to try it out.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.349 align:start position:0%
who builds on Stella to try it out. It it's really impressive. I I love how

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:36.549 align:start position:0%
It it's really impressive. I I love how how much is included how much you

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:38.710 align:start position:0%
how much is included how much you don't need to set up manually and

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.430 align:start position:0%
