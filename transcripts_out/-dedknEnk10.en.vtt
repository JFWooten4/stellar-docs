00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.070 align:start position:0%
the changes that we're discussing today and what we're focused on now is relate

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.389 align:start position:0%
and what we're focused on now is relate to project jump cannon so it's a future

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.190 align:start position:0%
to project jump cannon so it's a future protocol upgrade um these changes would

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.990 align:start position:0%
protocol upgrade um these changes would be included in it and project canon uh

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.070 align:start position:0%
be included in it and project canon uh is aims to bring smart contracts to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.230 align:start position:0%
is aims to bring smart contracts to stellar we've actually modularized a lot

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.150 align:start position:0%
stellar we've actually modularized a lot of these changes and so there's a whole

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.150 align:start position:0%
of these changes and so there's a whole slew of caps that are related to jump

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.109 align:start position:0%
slew of caps that are related to jump cannon caps 46 through 53.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.710 align:start position:0%
cannon caps 46 through 53. since this is a pretty technical

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.630 align:start position:0%
since this is a pretty technical discussion if you want to follow along i

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.870 align:start position:0%
discussion if you want to follow along i urge you to take a look at those caps if

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
urge you to take a look at those caps if you're interested in joining the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.509 align:start position:0%
you're interested in joining the discussion i urge you to join the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.430 align:start position:0%
discussion i urge you to join the stellar dev mailing list and if you want

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
stellar dev mailing list and if you want to also follow along with jump cannon

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.549 align:start position:0%
to also follow along with jump cannon development more generally

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.310 align:start position:0%
development more generally you can do so here

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.549 align:start position:0%
you can do so here in the jump cannon

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.630 align:start position:0%
in the jump cannon channel and also in the jump canon dev

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.950 align:start position:0%
channel and also in the jump canon dev channel um and so today again we're

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.590 align:start position:0%
channel um and so today again we're focused on on jump cannon related caps

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.510 align:start position:0%
focused on on jump cannon related caps there's a pretty uh there's there's a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.270 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty uh there's there's a lot on the agenda a lot of small stuff

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
lot on the agenda a lot of small stuff but there may also be some bigger issues

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.110 align:start position:0%
but there may also be some bigger issues that we're talking about um if as you're

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.189 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about um if as you're listening if you have questions

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.110 align:start position:0%
listening if you have questions the best thing to do is to put them in

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.830 align:start position:0%
the best thing to do is to put them in live chat uh in text i'll do my best to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
live chat uh in text i'll do my best to monitor it i mean the goal here is to

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.109 align:start position:0%
monitor it i mean the goal here is to actually have substantive discussion

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.789 align:start position:0%
actually have substantive discussion that moves forward some of these changes

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.390 align:start position:0%
that moves forward some of these changes and that answers questions and allows

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
and that answers questions and allows continued development so um we may or

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.230 align:start position:0%
continued development so um we may or may not have time to address the the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.990 align:start position:0%
may not have time to address the the issues in live chat but if we don't do

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
issues in live chat but if we don't do it now during this meeting we'll

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.350 align:start position:0%
it now during this meeting we'll definitely take a look at that channel

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.830 align:start position:0%
definitely take a look at that channel afterwards too so feel free to put your

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.310 align:start position:0%
afterwards too so feel free to put your questions or thoughts there and that's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.830 align:start position:0%
questions or thoughts there and that's the end of the intro um

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.149 align:start position:0%
the end of the intro um everybody here it looks like

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.510 align:start position:0%
everybody here it looks like looks like we got a full house um

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
looks like we got a full house um okay cool

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
okay cool so i guess to start off with we we have

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
so i guess to start off with we we have an agenda that has um

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.109 align:start position:0%
an agenda that has um like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.550 align:start position:0%
like and i guess we can just like sort of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.389 align:start position:0%
and i guess we can just like sort of start with what's at the top of the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
start with what's at the top of the agenda

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.590 align:start position:0%
agenda i also know that there's some questions

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.590 align:start position:0%
i also know that there's some questions about uh interoperability that we may

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.030 align:start position:0%
about uh interoperability that we may want to address

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.830 align:start position:0%
want to address i think maybe we start with

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 align:start position:0%
i think maybe we start with 46

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.109 align:start position:0%
46 removal of box agenda item i i put a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.190 align:start position:0%
removal of box agenda item i i put a bunch of i i put a bunch of agenda items

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.310 align:start position:0%
bunch of i i put a bunch of agenda items on here you can hear me

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.469 align:start position:0%
everyone hear me yeah we can hear you at least i can hear you yes okay

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.150 align:start position:0%
least i can hear you yes okay um yeah i put a bunch of agenda items on

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.589 align:start position:0%
um yeah i put a bunch of agenda items on here um but they're all really

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
here um but they're all really straightforward so i can just

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.630 align:start position:0%
straightforward so i can just grease them really quickly um

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.030 align:start position:0%
grease them really quickly um boxes in cat46 it's a it's an object

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.470 align:start position:0%
boxes in cat46 it's a it's an object that contains a value i think this is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
that contains a value i think this is actually just an artifact of the notion

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 align:start position:0%
actually just an artifact of the notion that we might have had mutable objects

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
that we might have had mutable objects because uh i think as far as i can tell

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.589 align:start position:0%
because uh i think as far as i can tell it's it's basically indistinguishable as

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.110 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically indistinguishable as long as we have immutable objects and we

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.350 align:start position:0%
long as we have immutable objects and we haven't ratified pointers there's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
haven't ratified pointers there's no way to differentiate an object that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.390 align:start position:0%
no way to differentiate an object that contains a value from just the value

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.990 align:start position:0%
contains a value from just the value so lee suggested that we get rid of this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.589 align:start position:0%
so lee suggested that we get rid of this and i'm happy to get rid of it until we

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.949 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to get rid of it until we discover or some reason to bring it back

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.949 align:start position:0%
discover or some reason to bring it back in the future

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.150 align:start position:0%
go on once go on twice i guess i have a maybe a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
go on twice i guess i have a maybe a question yep

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.509 align:start position:0%
question yep so is that does does that mean if if

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
so is that does does that mean if if later we decide to have mutable host

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.229 align:start position:0%
later we decide to have mutable host objects

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
objects they would just have to be boxed like

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.830 align:start position:0%
they would just have to be boxed like that that's right that's right that's it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.869 align:start position:0%
that that's right that's right that's it we'll just bring back so it's actually

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.149 align:start position:0%
we'll just bring back so it's actually completely back i mean forward

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
completely back i mean forward compatible but yeah we're just bringing

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
compatible but yeah we're just bringing we're just bringing the object like back

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.710 align:start position:0%
we're just bringing the object like back in the future it's just that since we

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.630 align:start position:0%
in the future it's just that since we don't have any reason for it right now

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
don't have any reason for it right now then we might not delete it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.070 align:start position:0%
then we might not delete it yeah makes sense

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
yeah makes sense okay

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.229 align:start position:0%
okay so

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
so yeah i just

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.949 align:start position:0%
yeah i just as a part of deleting this i want to get

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.869 align:start position:0%
as a part of deleting this i want to get rid of the cycle this gets rid of our

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.110 align:start position:0%
rid of the cycle this gets rid of our only cycle click reference in the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.550 align:start position:0%
only cycle click reference in the structure when i get i want to get rid

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
structure when i get i want to get rid of the option on the box so we

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.390 align:start position:0%
of the option on the box so we definitely can bring this back later on

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
definitely can bring this back later on but if we do bring this later on

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990 align:start position:0%
but if we do bring this later on we should put a little bit of effort

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.350 align:start position:0%
we should put a little bit of effort into making sure that the xdrpp the c

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.869 align:start position:0%
into making sure that the xdrpp the c plus xdlib

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.830 align:start position:0%
plus xdlib can do non-option cycling references

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
can do non-option cycling references which um there is already a plan for but

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
which um there is already a plan for but yeah just calling that out

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.470 align:start position:0%
yeah just calling that out yeah it's implemented in c plus plus 20

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.910 align:start position:0%
yeah it's implemented in c plus plus 20 so either

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.350 align:start position:0%
so either we can move stellar coordinates equals

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.149 align:start position:0%
we can move stellar coordinates equals plus 20 or we can back port it to c plus

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
plus 20 or we can back port it to c plus 17.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.710 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a so somewhat bigger kettle of fish but um i mean we have a

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
of fish but um i mean we have a workaround anyway if we really really

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
workaround anyway if we really really need it we really need to bring it back

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.429 align:start position:0%
need it we really need to bring it back we can move to an optional box like this

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.869 align:start position:0%
we can move to an optional box like this but this there this is motivated by

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.110 align:start position:0%
but this there this is motivated by getting rid of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.229 align:start position:0%
getting rid of so that'll actually make a lot of the on

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.869 align:start position:0%
so that'll actually make a lot of the on the wire stuff four bytes smaller

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.630 align:start position:0%
the wire stuff four bytes smaller okay second issue which is very very

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
okay second issue which is very very minor um we went with positive i-64 as

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
minor um we went with positive i-64 as the we renamed u-63 like two weeks ago

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.509 align:start position:0%
the we renamed u-63 like two weeks ago into positive i-64 to be a little bit

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.749 align:start position:0%
into positive i-64 to be a little bit clearer because 63 is a weird number and

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.909 align:start position:0%
clearer because 63 is a weird number and everyone who sees it is like what is

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.030 align:start position:0%
everyone who sees it is like what is what is that why should there be a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.550 align:start position:0%
what is that why should there be a 63-bit number and it's actually just

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.070 align:start position:0%
63-bit number and it's actually just like a 64-bit number that happens to be

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.070 align:start position:0%
like a 64-bit number that happens to be positive and john pointed out that you

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
positive and john pointed out that you know zero is in there and depending on

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.110 align:start position:0%
know zero is in there and depending on which mathematical tradition you come

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.629 align:start position:0%
which mathematical tradition you come from zero is either both positive and

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
from zero is either both positive and negative or neither positive and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
negative or neither positive and negative uh and some people believe

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.590 align:start position:0%
negative uh and some people believe non-negative is the correct word to use

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
non-negative is the correct word to use when you're including zero and a set of

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
when you're including zero and a set of numbers that include zero and all the

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
numbers that include zero and all the positive numbers

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
positive numbers i don't personally care i'm perfectly

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.189 align:start position:0%
i don't personally care i'm perfectly happy to have the word pause in there i

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.390 align:start position:0%
happy to have the word pause in there i think it's reasonably easy for people to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
think it's reasonably easy for people to understand i could also put in non-neg

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.070 align:start position:0%
understand i could also put in non-neg or n n or something like that but i

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.749 align:start position:0%
or n n or something like that but i figure terminology wise i've got you all

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.870 align:start position:0%
figure terminology wise i've got you all here

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.469 align:start position:0%
here we're gonna we're basically gonna merge

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're basically gonna merge this right now so please commit to a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
this right now so please commit to a terminology does anyone have a

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.909 align:start position:0%
terminology does anyone have a preference

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
i think non-nag is confined if that's more accurate but i don't really care i

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.749 align:start position:0%
more accurate but i don't really care i personally i think u63 was fine but yeah

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.749 align:start position:0%
personally i think u63 was fine but yeah not like is fine too i did too i don't

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.110 align:start position:0%
not like is fine too i did too i don't care

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
care i like u63 personally it's short and it

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.670 align:start position:0%
i like u63 personally it's short and it says what it means

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
says what it means um

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.870 align:start position:0%
um literally everyone who sees it has like

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.469 align:start position:0%
literally everyone who sees it has like this weird sour note in their mind and

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.230 align:start position:0%
this weird sour note in their mind and is like why is that 63 what is wrong

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.150 align:start position:0%
is like why is that 63 what is wrong with you 63 is not a computer number 64

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.590 align:start position:0%
with you 63 is not a computer number 64 is a computer but that is that is

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
is a computer but that is that is actually the correct and that is

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
actually the correct and that is actually the correct reaction because it

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
actually the correct reaction because it is a weird type

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.430 align:start position:0%
is a weird type so like except except it projects it

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
so like except except it projects it projects to and from i-64 so so the the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:0%
projects to and from i-64 so so the the the type that you can convert to and

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.390 align:start position:0%
the type that you can convert to and from is i-64 actually

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.270 align:start position:0%
from is i-64 actually why i-64 is not u64

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.710 align:start position:0%
why i-64 is not u64 that's the symptom of the language we're

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.070 align:start position:0%
that's the symptom of the language we're using too like you know if we were

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
using too like you know if we were writing contracts in zig u63 would

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
writing contracts in zig u63 would actually make sense it'd actually be a

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.430 align:start position:0%
actually make sense it'd actually be a thing

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.350 align:start position:0%
thing i mean the thing is like i don't think

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.950 align:start position:0%
i mean the thing is like i don't think the weird reaction is to the name i

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.230 align:start position:0%
the weird reaction is to the name i think the weird reaction is to the

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.230 align:start position:0%
think the weird reaction is to the concept but then in context it makes

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.550 align:start position:0%
concept but then in context it makes sense so why not just pick the more

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
sense so why not just pick the more accurate name but

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.710 align:start position:0%
accurate name but this seems like a mega bike shed thing

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.950 align:start position:0%
this seems like a mega bike shed thing it is a megabyte shed um

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
it is a megabyte shed um i'll go back to u63 if everyone wants

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
i'll go back to u63 if everyone wants you 63 but i will not entertain another

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
you 63 but i will not entertain another comment on this after this meeting so

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.230 align:start position:0%
comment on this after this meeting so this is it yes thank you uh i mean it's

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
this is it yes thank you uh i mean it's like boolean right like boolean is not

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.150 align:start position:0%
like boolean right like boolean is not one bit in most like if you have a

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.830 align:start position:0%
one bit in most like if you have a variable like that right it's already

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
variable like that right it's already the same thing so i'm fine with i'm

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.390 align:start position:0%
the same thing so i'm fine with i'm actually i prefer u63 as well because it

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.350 align:start position:0%
actually i prefer u63 as well because it actually tells you what it is

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
actually tells you what it is everyone wants you 63 okay we're going

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.950 align:start position:0%
everyone wants you 63 okay we're going back to u63 um

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.469 align:start position:0%
back to u63 um next issue was cap 47 and cat 53 we

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.309 align:start position:0%
next issue was cap 47 and cat 53 we noticed part way through last week that

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
noticed part way through last week that um

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.270 align:start position:0%
um assuming that we want some kind of

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
assuming that we want some kind of mutability of contracts which apparently

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.589 align:start position:0%
mutability of contracts which apparently we kind of do or even if we don't want

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.029 align:start position:0%
we kind of do or even if we don't want mutability of contract we still want a

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.589 align:start position:0%
mutability of contract we still want a way to load contract uh from the middle

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
way to load contract uh from the middle of execution

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
of execution because we want to be able to call them

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.070 align:start position:0%
because we want to be able to call them um and so at a representation level uh

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
um and so at a representation level uh the xdr that represents ledger entries

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.350 align:start position:0%
the xdr that represents ledger entries with separate ledger entries for code

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.870 align:start position:0%
with separate ledger entries for code and data

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
and data seemed possibly to be overkill and so we

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.189 align:start position:0%
seemed possibly to be overkill and so we talked about it and came to the

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.189 align:start position:0%
talked about it and came to the conclusion that it would probably be

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.189 align:start position:0%
conclusion that it would probably be tidier we actually had like like in the

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.350 align:start position:0%
tidier we actually had like like in the implementation we had um pages and pages

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
implementation we had um pages and pages of sql code for both of these types and

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.189 align:start position:0%
of sql code for both of these types and they're pretty much identical uh cedric

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.790 align:start position:0%
they're pretty much identical uh cedric and i worked through this stuff and then

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.870 align:start position:0%
and i worked through this stuff and then they really only differ on a you know

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
they really only differ on a you know one field which is whether there's an

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.909 align:start position:0%
one field which is whether there's an additional sub key

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.390 align:start position:0%
additional sub key so we thought that it might be nice to

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.749 align:start position:0%
so we thought that it might be nice to just merge those two and there's a

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.309 align:start position:0%
just merge those two and there's a single type of contract related entry

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
single type of contract related entry that still has a contract id they all

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
that still has a contract id they all have a contract id

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.909 align:start position:0%
have a contract id and has a sub key and the sub key has

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
and has a sub key and the sub key has one magic value carved out we have lots

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.309 align:start position:0%
one magic value carved out we have lots of places to carve magic values and we

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
of places to carve magic values and we can just carve them out of the sc static

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:52.869 align:start position:0%
can just carve them out of the sc static value set and we just have a designated

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.950 align:start position:0%
value set and we just have a designated key and all it means is the current

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.909 align:start position:0%
key and all it means is the current contracts or the the owning contracts

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.070 align:start position:0%
contracts or the the owning contracts own wasm code and then we just do our

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.270 align:start position:0%
own wasm code and then we just do our binary and sc binary type

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.550 align:start position:0%
binary and sc binary type and so we implemented that it seems to

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
and so we implemented that it seems to work fine um i have not updated the cap

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
work fine um i have not updated the cap yet i want to run that by everyone make

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.710 align:start position:0%
yet i want to run that by everyone make sure everyone's okay with it it it leans

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.029 align:start position:0%
sure everyone's okay with it it it leans us a little bit towards mutable

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:15.189 align:start position:0%
us a little bit towards mutable contracts but i believe a lot of our

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
contracts but i believe a lot of our design discussion has been drifting in

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.869 align:start position:0%
design discussion has been drifting in that direction anyway it does not wet us

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.629 align:start position:0%
that direction anyway it does not wet us to that we do not have to we could also

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.309 align:start position:0%
to that we do not have to we could also special case it and just prohibit rights

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:23.909 align:start position:0%
special case it and just prohibit rights to that key

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
to that key but it sort of

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
but it sort of has that tendency of treating code and

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
has that tendency of treating code and data as the same thing

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:32.310 align:start position:0%
data as the same thing which at some level they are

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.230 align:start position:0%
which at some level they are so i i spoke to siddharth about this

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.029 align:start position:0%
so i i spoke to siddharth about this yesterday quite a bit in the afternoon

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.269 align:start position:0%
yesterday quite a bit in the afternoon but one of the one of my main concerns

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.469 align:start position:0%
but one of the one of my main concerns around

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.630 align:start position:0%
around mutable code and this is much more about

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.230 align:start position:0%
mutable code and this is much more about the mutable code aspect of it than about

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
the mutable code aspect of it than about the merging them the merging it i care

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.870 align:start position:0%
the merging them the merging it i care less

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.389 align:start position:0%
less about other than the fact that it like

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.990 align:start position:0%
about other than the fact that it like makes them like default mutable and we

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.509 align:start position:0%
makes them like default mutable and we now need to opt back out of that which

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.949 align:start position:0%
now need to opt back out of that which i'm about to explain

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
i'm about to explain like

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.350 align:start position:0%
like you can't just say the code is mutable

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
you can't just say the code is mutable without having some rules around what

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.389 align:start position:0%
without having some rules around what that means

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
that means and we have not successfully agreed on

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
and we have not successfully agreed on what those rules are

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
what those rules are what happens if you mutate a code

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.310 align:start position:0%
what happens if you mutate a code mutated contract that's currently

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
mutated contract that's currently running what happens if you delete a

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.590 align:start position:0%
running what happens if you delete a contract that's currently running

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
contract that's currently running what happens if you

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
what happens if you delete a contract that is running then

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
delete a contract that is running then call another contract that called back

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
call another contract that called back into the first contract which contract

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
into the first contract which contract runs the second time

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.509 align:start position:0%
runs the second time like

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.750 align:start position:0%
like these things need to be well defined

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.509 align:start position:0%
these things need to be well defined so we should like start from the fact

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.190 align:start position:0%
so we should like start from the fact that we can

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.670 align:start position:0%
that we can store code as data but you can't mutate

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
store code as data but you can't mutate it and then figure out how to mutate it

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
it and then figure out how to mutate it um but like we don't have answers to

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.949 align:start position:0%
um but like we don't have answers to those questions yet or at least i

00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.389 align:start position:0%
those questions yet or at least i haven't heard answers to those kinds of

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.710 align:start position:0%
haven't heard answers to those kinds of questions yet

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.070 align:start position:0%
no i agree we don't we we did however uh have in cat 47 a function for writing

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.190 align:start position:0%
have in cat 47 a function for writing uh

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh a contract code entry so whatever that

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.430 align:start position:0%
a contract code entry so whatever that host function semantics are they're the

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.190 align:start position:0%
host function semantics are they're the same semantics here

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
same semantics here well the the thing is that uh yeah it's

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.829 align:start position:0%
well the the thing is that uh yeah it's like what john is saying like currently

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.230 align:start position:0%
like what john is saying like currently right like when you write a letter entry

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
right like when you write a letter entry the this is observable by anything after

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.710 align:start position:0%
the this is observable by anything after like immediately after whereas here i

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
like immediately after whereas here i think we we have to decide and we

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.670 align:start position:0%
think we we have to decide and we probably cannot make this actually uh

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.230 align:start position:0%
probably cannot make this actually uh this cannot be true i think

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.790 align:start position:0%
this cannot be true i think um because this is going to be

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
um because this is going to be probably scoped with the uh tied up to

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
probably scoped with the uh tied up to the lifetime of the

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
the lifetime of the um

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.230 align:start position:0%
um of the wasm runtime that's actually

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
of the wasm runtime that's actually executing the code so if you have like

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
executing the code so if you have like if you call yourself type of thing uh

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
if you call yourself type of thing uh we're certainly not going to we're not

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
we're certainly not going to we're not going to hot patch the the running one

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
going to hot patch the the running one exactly yeah so this is

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.949 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah so this is but this is like a place where this is

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.710 align:start position:0%
but this is like a place where this is actually deviating from what we do for

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.150 align:start position:0%
actually deviating from what we do for data

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
data so we have to really

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
so we have to really you know specify this and think about it

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.470 align:start position:0%
you know specify this and think about it very hard that's exactly what i was

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.470 align:start position:0%
very hard that's exactly what i was saying nico you just said yeah

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
saying nico you just said yeah no i know like it's it's kind of scary

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.990 align:start position:0%
no i know like it's it's kind of scary in a way that

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.509 align:start position:0%
in a way that i don't know what the right answer is on

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:52.150 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the right answer is on i

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
i know you see i don't i don't actually

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.870 align:start position:0%
know you see i don't i don't actually think this is this is particularly scary

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.470 align:start position:0%
think this is this is particularly scary i think there are really only two

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.470 align:start position:0%
i think there are really only two possible options and they're both fine

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
possible options and they're both fine um and you know one of them is you do

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
um and you know one of them is you do what unix does which is that you

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
what unix does which is that you um the executing process is essentially

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.269 align:start position:0%
um the executing process is essentially a disjoint as soon as it starts

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:11.110 align:start position:0%
a disjoint as soon as it starts executing and so if you rewrite the file

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
executing and so if you rewrite the file that's fine the next exec to that to

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.110 align:start position:0%
that's fine the next exec to that to that we'll get the new code

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.069 align:start position:0%
that we'll get the new code but like

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:18.230 align:start position:0%
but like so did we did we actually decide on

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
so did we did we actually decide on reentrancy for example like what you can

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.509 align:start position:0%
reentrancy for example like what you can or cannot do

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:26.389 align:start position:0%
or cannot do well actually you get you busy in unix

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
no you can write a file while it's running uh you get you get busy on

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
running uh you get you get busy on windows

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.430 align:start position:0%
windows the file's locked on windows while it's

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
the file's locked on windows while it's executing on unix you can rewrite the

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.790 align:start position:0%
executing on unix you can rewrite the file

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
file as far as i know

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.150 align:start position:0%
because i do upgrades of running programs all the time and it works

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:52.069 align:start position:0%
like if i if i upgrade chrome while it's running if i if i do apt-get install

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.389 align:start position:0%
running if i if i do apt-get install bash it works in my backup i'm telling

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:57.030 align:start position:0%
bash it works in my backup i'm telling you i literally just tested this um and

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
you i literally just tested this um and i get e busy um i mean this is kind of a

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.910 align:start position:0%
i get e busy um i mean this is kind of a side note but i think what you're doing

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.350 align:start position:0%
side note but i think what you're doing when you upgrade is you're unlinking the

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
when you upgrade is you're unlinking the file and creating a new file but you

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.949 align:start position:0%
file and creating a new file but you can't you can't like write to an inode

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.509 align:start position:0%
can't you can't like write to an inode that's currently executing okay sure

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:11.509 align:start position:0%
that's currently executing okay sure unlike you can re-link that's

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.509 align:start position:0%
unlike you can re-link that's fine well unlike and create a different

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.829 align:start position:0%
fine well unlike and create a different i know my point is it's it's totally

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.509 align:start position:0%
i know my point is it's it's totally doable in some contexts and in other

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.949 align:start position:0%
doable in some contexts and in other contexts you block it and those are the

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:20.629 align:start position:0%
contexts you block it and those are the only two options here so

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.670 align:start position:0%
only two options here so and i think they're both fine there are

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
and i think they're both fine there are other options okay there's the only two

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.110 align:start position:0%
other options okay there's the only two reasonable options the other one is what

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
reasonable options the other one is what hot patch your existing running program

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.629 align:start position:0%
hot patch your existing running program which you're not going to do no there's

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.389 align:start position:0%
which you're not going to do no there's at least one other option which is like

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
at least one other option which is like you can't update something while it's

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
you can't update something while it's running you have to delegate that's

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.949 align:start position:0%
running you have to delegate that's blocked that's what i just said that's

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
blocked that's what i just said that's the other option block or allow

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.190 align:start position:0%
the other option block or allow what what exactly do you mean by block i

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.190 align:start position:0%
what what exactly do you mean by block i guess it fails you try to make the right

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.470 align:start position:0%
guess it fails you try to make the right and the right fails it's just the

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
and the right fails it's just the special case we just don't know that's

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.509 align:start position:0%
special case we just don't know that's what right right right to the running

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
what right right right to the running the right to the running code fail

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.710 align:start position:0%
the right to the running code fail because we decided

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.150 align:start position:0%
because we decided but then how do you actually do the

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.230 align:start position:0%
but then how do you actually do the update i guess like you're just saying

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.310 align:start position:0%
update i guess like you're just saying you can't mutate it you can't take your

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
you can't mutate it you can't take your own you can you can mutate someone

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.350 align:start position:0%
own you can you can mutate someone else's

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
else's okay but like that needs a lot of

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.269 align:start position:0%
okay but like that needs a lot of specification in and of itself

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
specification in and of itself and i was providing an example of how

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.870 align:start position:0%
and i was providing an example of how you can do that you can't just like i

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
you can do that you can't just like i can't just modify your contract right

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.389 align:start position:0%
can't just modify your contract right like there's obvious that's obviously

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:10.069 align:start position:0%
like there's obvious that's obviously not acceptable

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:11.509 align:start position:0%
not acceptable um

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.230 align:start position:0%
um so

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
so but we have a we have a we have like

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
but we have a we have a we have like manage contract transactions right that

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.069 align:start position:0%
manage contract transactions right that that's that's the out-of-band technique

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:20.550 align:start position:0%
that's that's the out-of-band technique but like that doesn't work

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.790 align:start position:0%
but like that doesn't work like it works in a very like very tight

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.150 align:start position:0%
like it works in a very like very tight sense but like what if you're a dow

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.069 align:start position:0%
sense but like what if you're a dow that's managing a smart contract you'd

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:28.069 align:start position:0%
that's managing a smart contract you'd like to be able to manage it from small

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
like to be able to manage it from small right okay then we

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.150 align:start position:0%
right okay then we there's like a whole bunch of space here

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
there's like a whole bunch of space here that i'm like

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
that i'm like it's like sure maybe you have two

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.910 align:start position:0%
it's like sure maybe you have two high-level options allow or block but

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
high-level options allow or block but like block has many sub-options

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
okay i i i don't i don't see this is i don't see this is relating to the

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.750 align:start position:0%
i don't see this is relating to the question which is do we store this as a

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
question which is do we store this as a ledger entry or not i agree that

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.230 align:start position:0%
ledger entry or not i agree that individual host functions need to have

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.710 align:start position:0%
individual host functions need to have semantics defined for them but okay i

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.389 align:start position:0%
semantics defined for them but okay i guess what i'm getting at is

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.389 align:start position:0%
guess what i'm getting at is i would accept this change if we make it

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
i would accept this change if we make it so that you can't mutate the code while

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.670 align:start position:0%
so that you can't mutate the code while it's running right now

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.710 align:start position:0%
it's running right now um and we can figure it out later okay

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.230 align:start position:0%
um and we can figure it out later okay um but if you're going to allow it right

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
um but if you're going to allow it right now then we need to do a lot more work

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
now then we need to do a lot more work and it's not a good idea

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
sorry if we're if we allow rights to the currently running

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0%
allow rights to the currently running contract right we need to do more work

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
contract right we need to do more work okay um so

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
okay um so what i'm going to specify that agent

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.790 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to specify that agent files are currently immutable

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.470 align:start position:0%
files are currently immutable even if it's stored as data no the

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
even if it's stored as data no the currently running contract is immutable

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.150 align:start position:0%
currently running contract is immutable but we as i just said we have no

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.069 align:start position:0%
but we as i just said we have no mechanism to write to a not running

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
mechanism to write to a not running contract or not a good mechanism we

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.030 align:start position:0%
contract or not a good mechanism we should just make it immutable if it's

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
should just make it immutable if it's okay sure

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.030 align:start position:0%
okay sure like what i'm saying is let's separate

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.150 align:start position:0%
like what i'm saying is let's separate the mutability problem from the

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.590 align:start position:0%
the mutability problem from the representation problem okay

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
representation problem okay then we can make progress because like i

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.829 align:start position:0%
then we can make progress because like i i don't want to approve this if we don't

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.430 align:start position:0%
i don't want to approve this if we don't have like i don't want to prove it in

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.949 align:start position:0%
have like i don't want to prove it in the mutable case if we don't have a good

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:50.710 align:start position:0%
the mutable case if we don't have a good story about me to build and we don't

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.910 align:start position:0%
story about me to build and we don't right now gotcha okay so only only

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
right now gotcha okay so only only reading only the read path works for

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
reading only the read path works for this key right now and the right path

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
this key right now and the right path just fails

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
um i have a question about not about the mutability but the representation um if

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.269 align:start position:0%
mutability but the representation um if we're making it a ledger key that you

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.629 align:start position:0%
we're making it a ledger key that you have to write

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.629 align:start position:0%
have to write and in the future we do decide to

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.710 align:start position:0%
and in the future we do decide to support mutability

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.389 align:start position:0%
support mutability will it mean that the only way to update

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
will it mean that the only way to update the contract is to

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.550 align:start position:0%
the contract is to write the entire binary every time

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
write the entire binary every time or

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.350 align:start position:0%
or so like i'm just wondering about if

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.430 align:start position:0%
so like i'm just wondering about if somebody if we support mutability and

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.750 align:start position:0%
somebody if we support mutability and somebody wants to write a contract where

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.189 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to write a contract where they

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:31.189 align:start position:0%
they swap back and forth between multiple

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:33.269 align:start position:0%
swap back and forth between multiple implementations like rolling back or

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.670 align:start position:0%
implementations like rolling back or something like that

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.069 align:start position:0%
something like that and

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.509 align:start position:0%
just the cost of writing an entire contract which might

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.269 align:start position:0%
writing an entire contract which might be a couple of kilobytes

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:44.949 align:start position:0%
be a couple of kilobytes um versus

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.350 align:start position:0%
um versus store if this is just data storing this

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.629 align:start position:0%
store if this is just data storing this data

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.269 align:start position:0%
data um under you know just like regular data

00:15:51.279 --> 00:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
um under you know just like regular data and then having a point into that data

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense yeah it gets into what we talked about a

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.629 align:start position:0%
yeah it gets into what we talked about a little bit uh in yet another one of the

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:07.829 align:start position:0%
little bit uh in yet another one of the threads this week which is like is there

00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:10.629 align:start position:0%
threads this week which is like is there any kind of delegation mechanism

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:13.590 align:start position:0%
any kind of delegation mechanism um

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a little bit awkward because um

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.430 align:start position:0%
because um [Music]

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.790 align:start position:0%
[Music] well first of all we actually come up

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
well first of all we actually come up with a delegation mechanism that we can

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
with a delegation mechanism that we can all agree on which is

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
all agree on which is going to be

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
going to be weeks of conversation um but also you

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
weeks of conversation um but also you you wind up needing to pre-flight every

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.269 align:start position:0%
you wind up needing to pre-flight every single transaction in that case because

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:33.509 align:start position:0%
single transaction in that case because you need to resolve the

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
you need to resolve the current delegate well

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.389 align:start position:0%
current delegate well maybe you don't need to pre-flight them

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.509 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't need to pre-flight them if you can guess where the delegate is

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
if you can guess where the delegate is currently pointing but anyway

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
currently pointing but anyway i

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
i i feel like

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it increases the complexity of this and that's like i'm

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
complexity of this and that's like i'm not interested in increasing the

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.629 align:start position:0%
not interested in increasing the complexity i'm just curious if we're

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.829 align:start position:0%
complexity i'm just curious if we're just

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:55.430 align:start position:0%
just any sort of future

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.550 align:start position:0%
any sort of future limiting something we can do in the

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
limiting something we can do in the future

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.269 align:start position:0%
future i don't think so because again i think i

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
i don't think so because again i think i think

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
think um

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.910 align:start position:0%
um 47 already has a function called write

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.350 align:start position:0%
47 already has a function called write contract and it takes a binary like

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
contract and it takes a binary like that's that's the point here is to just

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
that's that's the point here is to just absorb the two representation questions

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.829 align:start position:0%
absorb the two representation questions not not necessarily to solve

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.949 align:start position:0%
not not necessarily to solve do we have

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:15.429 align:start position:0%
do we have proxy or delegation or whatever which

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
proxy or delegation or whatever which we might have but uh you know

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:20.230 align:start position:0%
we might have but uh you know when we had that conversation this week

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.829 align:start position:0%
when we had that conversation this week um

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.350 align:start position:0%
um john was really uh

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.029 align:start position:0%
john was really uh adamant about like let's let's ship

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
adamant about like let's let's ship without and see what happens and

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.789 align:start position:0%
without and see what happens and you know

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
you know i can i can live with that because we

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.230 align:start position:0%
i can i can live with that because we it's true like we could we could make

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.430 align:start position:0%
it's true like we could we could make the wrong

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.270 align:start position:0%
the wrong delegation mechanism and then we'd be

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.470 align:start position:0%
delegation mechanism and then we'd be stuck supporting it forever so

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:48.870 align:start position:0%
make sense

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
zoomed in focused on the representation question nobody has any real objections

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.070 align:start position:0%
okay i think it's really not contentious okay so the final thing i had on the

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
okay so the final thing i had on the agenda which is uh uh the footprint type

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
agenda which is uh uh the footprint type which is like even less contentious uh

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.750 align:start position:0%
which is like even less contentious uh i'll just be extending cat53 with a new

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.029 align:start position:0%
i'll just be extending cat53 with a new data type which is called footprint and

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
data type which is called footprint and it just contains two lists of ledger

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
it just contains two lists of ledger keys uh the only really possibly

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.750 align:start position:0%
keys uh the only really possibly contentious aspect of this i think is

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.909 align:start position:0%
contentious aspect of this i think is whether ledger keys full keys should be

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
whether ledger keys full keys should be there or whether they should be

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.909 align:start position:0%
there or whether they should be restricted to only contract data

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.590 align:start position:0%
restricted to only contract data values or

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.430 align:start position:0%
values or or value contract id pairs or something

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
or value contract id pairs or something like that something that is a little bit

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.190 align:start position:0%
like that something that is a little bit tighter than a ledger key but if we do

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
tighter than a ledger key but if we do that it means that we are essentially

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
that it means that we are essentially fixing

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.230 align:start position:0%
fixing the impossibility of interacting with

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.029 align:start position:0%
the impossibility of interacting with other ledger entries into the protocol

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.190 align:start position:0%
other ledger entries into the protocol uh going forward and i think the

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.789 align:start position:0%
uh going forward and i think the interoperability question

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:40.710 align:start position:0%
interoperability question still leaves that open so i was assuming

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.870 align:start position:0%
still leaves that open so i was assuming that they would be a full electric key

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.789 align:start position:0%
that they would be a full electric key at least that in conversation with john

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:47.029 align:start position:0%
at least that in conversation with john he again

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.230 align:start position:0%
he again fairly clearly suggested that he would

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.909 align:start position:0%
fairly clearly suggested that he would prefer to keep that door open and i'm

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:51.750 align:start position:0%
prefer to keep that door open and i'm happy to go with that so

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.830 align:start position:0%
happy to go with that so does anyone feel strongly

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
does anyone feel strongly what do you mean by footprint here you

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.549 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by footprint here you just mean the uh like

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
just mean the uh like sorry like the footprint is a term that

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
sorry like the footprint is a term that was introduced in cap uh

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.430 align:start position:0%
was introduced in cap uh oh the other one the data yeah it's what

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.789 align:start position:0%
oh the other one the data yeah it's what we have been calling up up until

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:09.430 align:start position:0%
we have been calling up up until recently the read write set um i

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.029 align:start position:0%
recently the read write set um i found that actually the paper that

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.549 align:start position:0%
found that actually the paper that introduces this concept of deterministic

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.830 align:start position:0%
introduces this concept of deterministic execution uses the word footprint and i

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.029 align:start position:0%
execution uses the word footprint and i think footprint is actually a great word

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.230 align:start position:0%
think footprint is actually a great word to use here so i've decided to start

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.470 align:start position:0%
to use here so i've decided to start using this one

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.470 align:start position:0%
using this one because otherwise you wind up with the

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you wind up with the read-only part of the read-write set and

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
read-only part of the read-write set and the read-write part of the read-write

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
the read-write part of the read-write set and honestly linguistically it's a

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
set and honestly linguistically it's a little bit clumsy

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
nobody cares about the footprint okay cool i'll just make it a lighter

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
cool i'll just make it a lighter keystone

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
that is the end of my agenda items i yield the floor to discussion of

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.870 align:start position:0%
yield the floor to discussion of interoperability or whatever else you

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.230 align:start position:0%
interoperability or whatever else you want to talk about

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.470 align:start position:0%
want to talk about thank you

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:59.029 align:start position:0%
john is this a discussion that that you want to kick off

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
want to kick off have questions

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.549 align:start position:0%
um are we switching now on onto like acid

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.630 align:start position:0%
are we switching now on onto like acid and drop stuff is that that where we are

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.549 align:start position:0%
and drop stuff is that that where we are yeah yeah yeah so i think that all we've

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah so i think that all we've sort of gone through all of the existing

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
sort of gone through all of the existing stuff on the agenda and the only thing

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
stuff on the agenda and the only thing that was a big question mark was the

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
that was a big question mark was the asset interoperability stuff and i think

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.950 align:start position:0%
asset interoperability stuff and i think that that's where we are at this point

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.350 align:start position:0%
that that's where we are at this point yeah i mean i think the only real thing

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think the only real thing to talk about here which like

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.870 align:start position:0%
to talk about here which like we have not

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to come to agreement on is

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
been able to come to agreement on is just like what are even the requirements

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.950 align:start position:0%
just like what are even the requirements what are we trying to achieve

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.909 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to achieve me nico tomer lee talk about this prop

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.590 align:start position:0%
me nico tomer lee talk about this prop like this problem i don't know like

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
like this problem i don't know like three times a week right now

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.950 align:start position:0%
three times a week right now and i don't even think we're all talking

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.549 align:start position:0%
and i don't even think we're all talking about the same thing so i think we just

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:44.549 align:start position:0%
about the same thing so i think we just need to talk about

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:48.230 align:start position:0%
need to talk about our feelings

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.230 align:start position:0%
so anybody can take before from that

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.630 align:start position:0%
yeah i love talking about my feelings so i'll start um

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.310 align:start position:0%
i'll start um yeah so i think you know the basic

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.590 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think you know the basic requirement

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
requirement from asset interop in my opinion is so

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
from asset interop in my opinion is so let's um

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
let's um maybe it's worth thinking about like the

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
maybe it's worth thinking about like the full spectrum of of interop or about the

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
full spectrum of of interop or about the edges um and where we are in the middle

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.110 align:start position:0%
edges um and where we are in the middle so

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
so you know i think like on one

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.190 align:start position:0%
you know i think like on one extreme interop

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.909 align:start position:0%
extreme interop uh thing we just do nothing right uh and

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:23.830 align:start position:0%
uh thing we just do nothing right uh and this is uh you can look for example at

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
this is uh you can look for example at like aurora on on near which is you know

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.149 align:start position:0%
like aurora on on near which is you know a whole blockchain running inside of the

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:30.549 align:start position:0%
a whole blockchain running inside of the blockchain that has like no interrupt

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
blockchain that has like no interrupt whatsoever and if you want to interrupt

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.590 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and if you want to interrupt with the parent chain you need to go

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.470 align:start position:0%
with the parent chain you need to go through

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.029 align:start position:0%
through uh you know various bridging solutions

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.350 align:start position:0%
uh you know various bridging solutions so i think that's a very extreme

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a very extreme version which is no interop at all um

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.350 align:start position:0%
version which is no interop at all um and it basically means that we're not

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
and it basically means that we're not taking advantage of the existing stellar

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the existing stellar ecosystem at all but it's extremely

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.909 align:start position:0%
ecosystem at all but it's extremely simple we just don't need to think about

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.630 align:start position:0%
simple we just don't need to think about legacy um interop at all

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.549 align:start position:0%
legacy um interop at all i think on the other extreme side of

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
i think on the other extreme side of interop you have full interop with every

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
interop you have full interop with every primitive

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.870 align:start position:0%
primitive on the current stellar network so you

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.029 align:start position:0%
on the current stellar network so you can do things like interrupt between

00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
can do things like interrupt between smart contracts and amms and the order

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.710 align:start position:0%
smart contracts and amms and the order book and uh

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.350 align:start position:0%
book and uh sponsorships and and like the wide

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.830 align:start position:0%
sponsorships and and like the wide everything that stellar

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.270 align:start position:0%
everything that stellar proposes and that

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.789 align:start position:0%
proposes and that you know is great for like supporting

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.630 align:start position:0%
you know is great for like supporting legacy but it's also terrible because it

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
legacy but it's also terrible because it means that we're bringing a lot of the

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
means that we're bringing a lot of the um you know technical debt uh and the

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.310 align:start position:0%
um you know technical debt uh and the idiosyncrasies and in the classic

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrasies and in the classic protocol to the new world so

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.149 align:start position:0%
protocol to the new world so i think we need to find somewhere in

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:29.110 align:start position:0%
i think we need to find somewhere in between

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
between um and i would say that even though

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
um and i would say that even though there are a lot of disagreements in this

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.909 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of disagreements in this in this room i think the basic thing

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.830 align:start position:0%
in this room i think the basic thing that we agree on is that

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
that we agree on is that assets are the main point of

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.230 align:start position:0%
assets are the main point of interoperability like we're not trying

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.270 align:start position:0%
interoperability like we're not trying to bring the order books we're not

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.870 align:start position:0%
to bring the order books we're not trying to bring amms

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.190 align:start position:0%
trying to bring amms we just want to make sure that classic

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.149 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that classic assets will operate in um in smartland

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
assets will operate in um in smartland and

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
and um

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
um [Music]

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
[Music] you know basically like asset issuers

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
you know basically like asset issuers still have their

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.630 align:start position:0%
still have their uh infrastructure intact and and they

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.149 align:start position:0%
uh infrastructure intact and and they don't need to make changes

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
don't need to make changes and so we have

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.430 align:start position:0%
and so we have you know service providers like you know

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.510 align:start position:0%
you know service providers like you know fire blocks and bitcoin all these folks

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
fire blocks and bitcoin all these folks you know their services are still

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
you know their services are still you know viable in working even

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
you know viable in working even in this world without

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.669 align:start position:0%
in this world without without a change

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to people

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
oh maybe uh i'll i'll pick it up because yeah like with the without a

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.990 align:start position:0%
because yeah like with the without a change it's kind of uh like uh that's

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
change it's kind of uh like uh that's the part that's right that is kind of uh

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.789 align:start position:0%
the part that's right that is kind of uh reloaded i would say

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
reloaded i would say um like the uh

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
um like the uh like

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
like as soon as you as we say

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.310 align:start position:0%
as soon as you as we say there's basically like um

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.830 align:start position:0%
there's basically like um there are two parts to it right there is

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
there are two parts to it right there is the

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.750 align:start position:0%
the um do i expect

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.110 align:start position:0%
um do i expect on day one

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
on day one as soon as we have like uh

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.549 align:start position:0%
as soon as we have like uh smart cr smart contract capabilities

00:23:58.559 --> 00:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
smart cr smart contract capabilities can i use

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.190 align:start position:0%
can i use any classic asset on the network kind of

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.029 align:start position:0%
any classic asset on the network kind of automatically right

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:06.070 align:start position:0%
automatically right or not

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.950 align:start position:0%
or not like using uh smart and that

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.149 align:start position:0%
like using uh smart and that to me

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:12.710 align:start position:0%
to me is like one version of that extreme

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.549 align:start position:0%
is like one version of that extreme inside this box that you described where

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:18.149 align:start position:0%
inside this box that you described where you know no change is needed um

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:22.070 align:start position:0%
you know no change is needed um and um

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.310 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm we've been kind of trying to and john probably can expand on that but

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.310 align:start position:0%
and john probably can expand on that but like it it seems to me that

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.630 align:start position:0%
like it it seems to me that if we try to make it

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
if we try to make it that extreme

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.510 align:start position:0%
that extreme um

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.070 align:start position:0%
um we we are kind of uh

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
we we are kind of uh really over constraining

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
really over constraining what type of things you can do in smart

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%
what type of things you can do in smart uh in terms of uh

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:47.430 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of uh those assets right because um

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.190 align:start position:0%
those assets right because um you expect those assets to be

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.149 align:start position:0%
you expect those assets to be represented by uh trust lines and and

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.269 align:start position:0%
represented by uh trust lines and and you have like all those things right

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.549 align:start position:0%
you have like all those things right that comes with that and you have like

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:57.269 align:start position:0%
that comes with that and you have like the semantics that are really

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
the semantics that are really um specific right to classic um

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.669 align:start position:0%
um specific right to classic um so that there is like that version i

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
so that there is like that version i think there is a

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
think there is a maybe a more

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.669 align:start position:0%
maybe a more nuanced you know version of this that is

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:11.669 align:start position:0%
nuanced you know version of this that is uh yeah like what

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:13.990 align:start position:0%
uh yeah like what um

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
um like what what do you mean when you say

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.549 align:start position:0%
like what what do you mean when you say like no change does it mean

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:20.470 align:start position:0%
like no change does it mean um

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.070 align:start position:0%
um that uh

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.789 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah you want to have people that issue

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:26.549 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to have people that issue tokens on stella

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:29.029 align:start position:0%
tokens on stella they want to make sure that uh

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.710 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that uh they contin we don't break their

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.390 align:start position:0%
they contin we don't break their compliance story or whatever they they

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.710 align:start position:0%
compliance story or whatever they they have right in terms of like uh what they

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.669 align:start position:0%
have right in terms of like uh what they are

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.269 align:start position:0%
are what they sign up for basically with the

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
what they sign up for basically with the network right like we're expanding the

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.950 align:start position:0%
network right like we're expanding the the set of

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.549 align:start position:0%
the set of capabilities um

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
capabilities um and uh

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
and uh and this one is it sounds more to me

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
and this one is it sounds more to me like uh

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
like uh like there's like some room there where

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.750 align:start position:0%
like there's like some room there where you can say well maybe

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.350 align:start position:0%
you can say well maybe um

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
um maybe people need to like issue us in

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
maybe people need to like issue us in this context of classic assets need to

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
this context of classic assets need to uh have like a

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
uh have like a kind of

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
kind of opt into uh smart capabilities and maybe

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.630 align:start position:0%
opt into uh smart capabilities and maybe they have like a way to specify which

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.470 align:start position:0%
they have like a way to specify which subset of the capabilities they are

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.230 align:start position:0%
subset of the capabilities they are interested in and

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
interested in and when you do that

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.789 align:start position:0%
when you do that then you have like maybe a

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:19.029 align:start position:0%
then you have like maybe a a different um

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:21.669 align:start position:0%
a different um way to represent those assets uh kind of

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:23.029 align:start position:0%
way to represent those assets uh kind of like when we introduce claimable

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
like when we introduce claimable balances like claimable balances are

00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
balances like claimable balances are actually a a good example of

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.470 align:start position:0%
actually a a good example of where we

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.789 align:start position:0%
where we kind of introduced this this way to kind

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
kind of introduced this this way to kind of go uh in a way like uh that was

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.590 align:start position:0%
of go uh in a way like uh that was actually breaking a little bit in terms

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.430 align:start position:0%
actually breaking a little bit in terms of compliance but at the same time

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
we try to be

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
for tokens that don't have a lot of restrictions

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.110 align:start position:0%
restrictions claimable balances are kind of uh can

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.430 align:start position:0%
claimable balances are kind of uh can flow uh freely right

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.110 align:start position:0%
flow uh freely right and to me like

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.190 align:start position:0%
and to me like trying to do a similar thing with smart

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.950 align:start position:0%
trying to do a similar thing with smart is probably um like a

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.029 align:start position:0%
is probably um like a would be probably a good middle ground

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:08.710 align:start position:0%
would be probably a good middle ground but for that it's an opt-in so that

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.310 align:start position:0%
but for that it's an opt-in so that means you don't get automatically like

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.070 align:start position:0%
means you don't get automatically like everybody you know every classic asset

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.310 align:start position:0%
everybody you know every classic asset kind of shows up on day one

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think cable balances are a really good

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.549 align:start position:0%
really good example

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.470 align:start position:0%
example um you know they're a fairly novel

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
um you know they're a fairly novel concept and for the most part aside from

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:29.190 align:start position:0%
concept and for the most part aside from um you know a small set of like super

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.669 align:start position:0%
um you know a small set of like super specific stellar wallets uh it we we

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:35.430 align:start position:0%
specific stellar wallets uh it we we haven't even seen um support for them

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.669 align:start position:0%
haven't even seen um support for them and with major service providers

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:40.310 align:start position:0%
and with major service providers um so it's worth you know when i'm when

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.630 align:start position:0%
um so it's worth you know when i'm when i'm talking about minimal change i think

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.750 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about minimal change i think it's worth

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.430 align:start position:0%
it's worth dividing this into the different

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
dividing this into the different stakeholders that we're talking about

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.549 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that we're talking about so

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:51.029 align:start position:0%
so um i think on one end you have

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:53.830 align:start position:0%
um i think on one end you have the more kind of like institutional

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.269 align:start position:0%
the more kind of like institutional cross-chain services things like

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
cross-chain services things like exchanges things like um you know things

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.830 align:start position:0%
exchanges things like um you know things like fire blocks and bitco things like

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.549 align:start position:0%
like fire blocks and bitco things like um

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:04.789 align:start position:0%
um you know even like circle as an issuer

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.230 align:start position:0%
you know even like circle as an issuer like these folks

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
like these folks um you know take the path of least

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
um you know take the path of least resistance it's been even difficult to

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.190 align:start position:0%
resistance it's been even difficult to get muxed accounts implemented with

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.230 align:start position:0%
get muxed accounts implemented with these folks so i would say that from

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
these folks so i would say that from their perspective

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.950 align:start position:0%
their perspective we

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
we uh like zero change is preferable

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
uh like zero change is preferable now

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.909 align:start position:0%
now for the actual touch points uh for these

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:28.870 align:start position:0%
for the actual touch points uh for these smart contracts obviously uh it's okay

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.149 align:start position:0%
smart contracts obviously uh it's okay to introduce change right like if a

00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
to introduce change right like if a wallet wants to interact with uh with uh

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:34.710 align:start position:0%
wallet wants to interact with uh with uh some crypto primitive uh some smart

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
some crypto primitive uh some smart contract and then obviously they need to

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.470 align:start position:0%
contract and then obviously they need to introduce changes and it's okay you know

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
introduce changes and it's okay you know so uh you know on the wallet side itself

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.630 align:start position:0%
so uh you know on the wallet side itself and from a user perspective that's

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.389 align:start position:0%
and from a user perspective that's trying to use the smart side it's

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:48.230 align:start position:0%
trying to use the smart side it's definitely okay to introduce uh some uh

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.950 align:start position:0%
definitely okay to introduce uh some uh some changes uh and can i have actually

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.789 align:start position:0%
some changes uh and can i have actually have a question on exchanges like when

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
have a question on exchanges like when you say like exchanges don't need to

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
you say like exchanges don't need to make sure well like exchanges today

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.630 align:start position:0%
make sure well like exchanges today don't most many exchanges don't support

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.430 align:start position:0%
don't most many exchanges don't support any

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.470 align:start position:0%
any stellar assets other than lumen

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.230 align:start position:0%
stellar assets other than lumen so like why is that relevant in that

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.389 align:start position:0%
so like why is that relevant in that conversation uh it's relevant because of

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:08.310 align:start position:0%
conversation uh it's relevant because of usdc it's relevant because there is a

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
usdc it's relevant because there is a group of exchanges that support usdc and

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.750 align:start position:0%
group of exchanges that support usdc and don't right

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.830 align:start position:0%
don't right it's growing you know and it's growing

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.310 align:start position:0%
it's growing you know and it's growing but like over time do you i mean

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.549 align:start position:0%
but like over time do you i mean wouldn't you expect

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you expect people like if they are like any good

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.669 align:start position:0%
people like if they are like any good assets being issued on the

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
assets being issued on the smart side that they would be supported

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.269 align:start position:0%
smart side that they would be supported by those uh exchanges

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.230 align:start position:0%
so it's not like they are going to like a phone exchange it's a bit of a

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.310 align:start position:0%
a phone exchange it's a bit of a different story right they have existing

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.789 align:start position:0%
different story right they have existing things

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
they're not issuing tokens right they are it's more like they have a wallet in

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.310 align:start position:0%
are it's more like they have a wallet in classic and you want their water to

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.389 align:start position:0%
classic and you want their water to continue to work

00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
continue to work right and i mean i think at some point

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
right and i mean i think at some point if they decide that smart assets are

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.549 align:start position:0%
if they decide that smart assets are interesting and they want to opt in to

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.630 align:start position:0%
interesting and they want to opt in to make the changes great but they they're

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
make the changes great but they they're probably not going to be the first

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.710 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be the first people to do it's probably going to take

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.389 align:start position:0%
people to do it's probably going to take them a while and it sounds like we just

00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.909 align:start position:0%
them a while and it sounds like we just don't want to break them

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:01.590 align:start position:0%
don't want to break them yeah that's fine but like i don't think

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.590 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine but like i don't think we we ne

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
we we ne none of the proposals so far are saying

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
none of the proposals so far are saying we would break classic wallets

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:12.710 align:start position:0%
we would break classic wallets um no but we are saying for example you

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.909 align:start position:0%
um no but we are saying for example you know if we're going to recommend issuing

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:20.230 align:start position:0%
know if we're going to recommend issuing on smart going forward then the issuer

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.470 align:start position:0%
on smart going forward then the issuer has like this tough decision

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.549 align:start position:0%
has like this tough decision where they need to make a decision

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:25.909 align:start position:0%
where they need to make a decision whether the issue

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:28.230 align:start position:0%
whether the issue on the old path which maybe is not

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.230 align:start position:0%
on the old path which maybe is not recommended anymore but is what the

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.789 align:start position:0%
recommended anymore but is what the exchanges actually know how to support

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
exchanges actually know how to support or issuing on the classic side

00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
or issuing on the classic side and you know based on our previous

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
and you know based on our previous experience it's going to take

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
experience it's going to take you know a whole lot of time for service

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
you know a whole lot of time for service providers to start enabling something

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.230 align:start position:0%
providers to start enabling something new

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.470 align:start position:0%
i get that i'm just kind of uh a bit skeptical about

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.070 align:start position:0%
skeptical about like the uh

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
like the uh for exchanges in particular that

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
for exchanges in particular that they won't do like basically i think

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.269 align:start position:0%
they won't do like basically i think there are two types of exchanges the

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:03.029 align:start position:0%
there are two types of exchanges the exchanges that are going to be

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
exchanges that are going to be supporting whatever the latest set of

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:07.990 align:start position:0%
supporting whatever the latest set of functions i mean they are going to kind

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.230 align:start position:0%
functions i mean they are going to kind of keep up maybe like you know with some

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.149 align:start position:0%
of keep up maybe like you know with some delay but they are kind of keeping up

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:14.070 align:start position:0%
delay but they are kind of keeping up and then you have others that are very

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
and then you have others that are very conservative and going to be slow um

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.350 align:start position:0%
conservative and going to be slow um and i think that's why for example i

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.909 align:start position:0%
and i think that's why for example i think we don't have still uh

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:25.190 align:start position:0%
think we don't have still uh usdc on coinbase i think right stellar

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.789 align:start position:0%
usdc on coinbase i think right stellar usdc

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:28.470 align:start position:0%
usdc coinbase

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
coinbase according to foreign sources doesn't

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.630 align:start position:0%
according to foreign sources doesn't have any multi-chain assets right now

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.350 align:start position:0%
have any multi-chain assets right now because of um extensive technical and

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
because of um extensive technical and product debt uh that coinbase is a bit

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.789 align:start position:0%
product debt uh that coinbase is a bit of a special case

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:40.389 align:start position:0%
of a special case uh because they don't even support they

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:43.870 align:start position:0%
uh because they don't even support they don't support any like usd any non erc20

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.909 align:start position:0%
don't support any like usd any non erc20 usdc um but we do have

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:50.389 align:start position:0%
usdc um but we do have uh and like it's a

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:52.789 align:start position:0%
uh and like it's a it's a pickle it's difficult uh because

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
it's a pickle it's difficult uh because exchanges uh you know there's a bit of a

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
exchanges uh you know there's a bit of a chicken and egg that you know they want

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.430 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg that you know they want to see demand

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
to see demand um and then it's hard to create that

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.750 align:start position:0%
um and then it's hard to create that demand without um you know these assets

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
demand without um you know these assets supporting supported domain exchanges

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.149 align:start position:0%
supporting supported domain exchanges um

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.230 align:start position:0%
um but i think like the main thing i'm

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.110 align:start position:0%
but i think like the main thing i'm trying to together here is that like

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.549 align:start position:0%
trying to together here is that like it's hard to get exchanges to to do

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:16.710 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get exchanges to to do changes uh and the service providers as

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
changes uh and the service providers as well like folks like bitcoin fire blocks

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
well like folks like bitcoin fire blocks right and right now

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.350 align:start position:0%
right and right now is uh you know the way that you issue

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
is uh you know the way that you issue assets on stellar

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
assets on stellar um you know the actual distribution is

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
um you know the actual distribution is just regular payments right

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.149 align:start position:0%
just regular payments right so

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
so you know you can do it on all these

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.190 align:start position:0%
you know you can do it on all these platforms

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.590 align:start position:0%
platforms if you introduce a new way to do it then

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.509 align:start position:0%
if you introduce a new way to do it then you basically tell issuers you can't use

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:43.509 align:start position:0%
you basically tell issuers you can't use these service providers

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.149 align:start position:0%
i mean that's not really what you're telling them what you're telling them is

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:48.310 align:start position:0%
telling them what you're telling them is you can't use those service providers if

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
you can't use those service providers if you want to do it the new way

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
right so what you're suggesting is having like this

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
having like this uh like a split thing in the ecosystem

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
uh like a split thing in the ecosystem where you say hey you can issue an asset

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
where you say hey you can issue an asset in one of both ways

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
in one of both ways um

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
um this way will give you like you know

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.029 align:start position:0%
this way will give you like you know like a shorter path to exchanges and you

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:14.870 align:start position:0%
like a shorter path to exchanges and you can work with uh

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
can work with uh um you know various service providers

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
um you know various service providers um and the

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.549 align:start position:0%
um and the other path will give you

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:27.029 align:start position:0%
other path will give you will give you what john

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.789 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it'll give you it'll give you the power to do whatever you

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:33.590 align:start position:0%
give you the power to do whatever you want the question is what do you want

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.549 align:start position:0%
want the question is what do you want right

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
if they don't want those things you probably shouldn't do it right

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.950 align:start position:0%
yeah like like if you think of uh what we have

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.310 align:start position:0%
like if you think of uh what we have right now for the network right we are

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.269 align:start position:0%
right now for the network right we are kind of optimizing for payments

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:53.669 align:start position:0%
kind of optimizing for payments if the token that you're issuing is not

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:55.509 align:start position:0%
if the token that you're issuing is not meant to be used for

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:58.710 align:start position:0%
meant to be used for directly supporting payments

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.710 align:start position:0%
directly supporting payments then there's no reason to issue it

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.430 align:start position:0%
then there's no reason to issue it as a classic asset

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:11.349 align:start position:0%
like think of like you know nfts or all sorts of random things like that

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:14.069 align:start position:0%
sorts of random things like that yeah

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
so as i said like if you if you if you issue on classic then you have the

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.629 align:start position:0%
issue on classic then you have the entire breadth of like classic tooling

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.990 align:start position:0%
entire breadth of like classic tooling available at your disposal right now

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.430 align:start position:0%
available at your disposal right now like every wallet every exchange

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.669 align:start position:0%
like every wallet every exchange everything that supports on classic

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.869 align:start position:0%
everything that supports on classic um you have at your disposal it's so yes

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
um you have at your disposal it's so yes it's about payments but it's just about

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.470 align:start position:0%
it's about payments but it's just about like the ecosystem support

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.230 align:start position:0%
i think like payments are also just transfers so

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.470 align:start position:0%
like payments are also just transfers so i'm it's also not clear to me why why we

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.869 align:start position:0%
i'm it's also not clear to me why why we would even say that nfts don't care

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.230 align:start position:0%
would even say that nfts don't care about payments because people do care

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.149 align:start position:0%
about payments because people do care about transferring nfts

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.389 align:start position:0%
about transferring nfts yeah but we're not going to have

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:49.990 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're not going to have that is actually kind of broken if

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
that is actually kind of broken if you're modeling

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.270 align:start position:0%
you're modeling like that's kind of what we see today on

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
like that's kind of what we see today on the network right like the way your

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.109 align:start position:0%
the network right like the way your model nft is on the network is extremely

00:34:57.119 --> 00:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
model nft is on the network is extremely poor the experience that you get

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:09.670 align:start position:0%
i guess one question is like do do we think that kind of the the

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.829 align:start position:0%
do do we think that kind of the the value of the smart contracts is going to

00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:14.230 align:start position:0%
value of the smart contracts is going to come from people implementing new assets

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.270 align:start position:0%
come from people implementing new assets or do we think the value value's going

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.349 align:start position:0%
or do we think the value value's going to come from like taking high quality

00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:20.069 align:start position:0%
to come from like taking high quality assets that are issued by people who are

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:20.950 align:start position:0%
assets that are issued by people who are you know

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.750 align:start position:0%
you know not

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.430 align:start position:0%
not uh you know that are that are not

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh you know that are that are not particularly

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
particularly uh you know experimental

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh you know experimental and then innovators are going to come

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
and then innovators are going to come and like make new use of those assets so

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.710 align:start position:0%
and like make new use of those assets so my

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.190 align:start position:0%
my suspicion is that maybe this the latter

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
suspicion is that maybe this the latter is is is better and so that that kind of

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
is is is better and so that that kind of it's more important to interoperate well

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.230 align:start position:0%
it's more important to interoperate well with existing assets that might be

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
with existing assets that might be issued

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.750 align:start position:0%
issued by somebody else and to be able to like

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.069 align:start position:0%
by somebody else and to be able to like program those assets than to be able to

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
program those assets than to be able to create some new ecosystem that's not

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
create some new ecosystem that's not that's more divorced from the existing

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.310 align:start position:0%
that's more divorced from the existing one

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
one so i think there are

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.550 align:start position:0%
so i think there are uh it's probably both david because

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.069 align:start position:0%
uh it's probably both david because you're gonna have yes you're gonna have

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:01.990 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have yes you're gonna have you know the the stable coins usdc and

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
you know the the stable coins usdc and such that are going to be used heavily

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.150 align:start position:0%
such that are going to be used heavily in these smart contracts but you also

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.230 align:start position:0%
in these smart contracts but you also are going to have things like governance

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
are going to have things like governance tokens uni style

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
tokens uni style tokens and dao style tokens

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
tokens and dao style tokens and these are going to be issued on

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.589 align:start position:0%
and these are going to be issued on the smart side

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:19.190 align:start position:0%
the smart side you know we might say hey you know what

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
you know we might say hey you know what we don't actually care about

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
we don't actually care about about these assets being

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.109 align:start position:0%
about these assets being transferable um as regular payment on

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:29.750 align:start position:0%
transferable um as regular payment on the classic side uh and maybe that helps

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
the classic side uh and maybe that helps with um

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.829 align:start position:0%
with um uh with implementation uh but we will

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:36.550 align:start position:0%
uh with implementation uh but we will see these assets but but i mean i guess

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
see these assets but but i mean i guess i mean put another way like when i talk

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
i mean put another way like when i talk to people who are using stellar right

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
to people who are using stellar right it's it's it's often kind of two things

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.990 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's often kind of two things that draw them stellar like sort of the

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.589 align:start position:0%
that draw them stellar like sort of the the perception of like high quality

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
the perception of like high quality assets and low transaction fees

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.550 align:start position:0%
assets and low transaction fees and so if like those are the strengths

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.230 align:start position:0%
and so if like those are the strengths then we want to kind of

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.310 align:start position:0%
then we want to kind of make sure that those strengths are uh

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.750 align:start position:0%
make sure that those strengths are uh we don't want to kind of like sacrifice

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.270 align:start position:0%
we don't want to kind of like sacrifice those strengths and create a completely

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
those strengths and create a completely new ecosystem right we want to be able

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.069 align:start position:0%
new ecosystem right we want to be able to kind of

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
to kind of maybe for higher transaction fees add

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.829 align:start position:0%
maybe for higher transaction fees add more flexibility but where like you can

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:07.030 align:start position:0%
more flexibility but where like you can still do things with like low

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
still do things with like low transaction fees and do things with like

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
transaction fees and do things with like existing legacy assets right like that

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.589 align:start position:0%
existing legacy assets right like that that seems to me like the

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
that seems to me like the the

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
the the thing that we want to optimize for

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.390 align:start position:0%
the thing that we want to optimize for of course it's going to be like whatever

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
of course it's going to be like whatever turn complete in general but but the

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.589 align:start position:0%
turn complete in general but but the thing we want to optimize for that's

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.030 align:start position:0%
thing we want to optimize for that's going to make this special is the

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
going to make this special is the ability to

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.790 align:start position:0%
ability to also leverage these high quality assets

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.310 align:start position:0%
also leverage these high quality assets and low transaction fees for people who

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.829 align:start position:0%
and low transaction fees for people who are just doing simple payments and

00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
are just doing simple payments and that's not going to work for everything

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.630 align:start position:0%
that's not going to work for everything but

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.829 align:start position:0%
but um

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:35.349 align:start position:0%
um but there are probably a lot of cases

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
but there are probably a lot of cases where like you know

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.109 align:start position:0%
where like you know people are going to want to use usdc for

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:41.109 align:start position:0%
people are going to want to use usdc for example right and and maybe we don't

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
example right and and maybe we don't want to get circled to like write some

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
want to get circled to like write some whole new smart contract to implement

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
whole new smart contract to implement this we just want somehow

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.910 align:start position:0%
this we just want somehow like unilaterally people can write

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:57.829 align:start position:0%
like unilaterally people can write contracts that do things with usdc

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.430 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we're getting into a lot of speculation and somewhat like religious

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
speculation and somewhat like religious discussions here

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.069 align:start position:0%
discussions here john can you help us like fine tune

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
john can you help us like fine tune um like where where do things get hairy

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.430 align:start position:0%
um like where where do things get hairy in terms of interop and what kind of

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.230 align:start position:0%
in terms of interop and what kind of like

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.910 align:start position:0%
like uh you know decisions we can make to

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh you know decisions we can make to simplify that

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.349 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a couple axes of decisions

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:28.550 align:start position:0%
axes of decisions uh one axis is like wrapping verse not

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.550 align:start position:0%
uh one axis is like wrapping verse not wrapping

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.390 align:start position:0%
wrapping wrapping generally makes everything

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
wrapping generally makes everything easier implementation-wise like

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
easier implementation-wise like significantly so

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.550 align:start position:0%
significantly so um but like the ux might or might not be

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.589 align:start position:0%
um but like the ux might or might not be better

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:41.910 align:start position:0%
better that's up to your interpretation

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.990 align:start position:0%
that's up to your interpretation uh if you don't have a wrapping

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.349 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't have a wrapping interface so that's one axis

00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:50.390 align:start position:0%
interface so that's one axis a second axis of is like

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.589 align:start position:0%
a second axis of is like should a

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.829 align:start position:0%
should a classic asset

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:56.470 align:start position:0%
classic asset when used from the smart perspective

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
when used from the smart perspective look exactly like a smart asset used

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.950 align:start position:0%
look exactly like a smart asset used from the smart perspective should they

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.030 align:start position:0%
from the smart perspective should they look identical

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.230 align:start position:0%
look identical should they behave identically

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.589 align:start position:0%
should they behave identically and the third main access is like should

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
and the third main access is like should you be able to take a smart asset and

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.790 align:start position:0%
you be able to take a smart asset and easily send it back to the

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.790 align:start position:0%
easily send it back to the classic side

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.109 align:start position:0%
classic side uh

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.349 align:start position:0%
that access is more speculative i think but those are kind of like the three

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:25.109 align:start position:0%
but those are kind of like the three angles that one might look at this

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:48.710 align:start position:0%
angles that one might look at this problem

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.230 align:start position:0%
one thing that uh is noticeable in other ecosystems is that there's definitely

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
ecosystems is that there's definitely the canonical way of doing assets right

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
the canonical way of doing assets right on on the ethereum ecosystem even though

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.470 align:start position:0%
on on the ethereum ecosystem even though you can write your own contract everyone

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.510 align:start position:0%
you can write your own contract everyone just uh

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.069 align:start position:0%
just uh you know copy paste the the or imports

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.109 align:start position:0%
you know copy paste the the or imports the

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.950 align:start position:0%
the the open zeppelin one

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.910 align:start position:0%
the open zeppelin one um you know solana has like the spl

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.589 align:start position:0%
um you know solana has like the spl um other ecosystems have like their

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:13.270 align:start position:0%
um other ecosystems have like their baked in contracts uh for uh for assets

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
baked in contracts uh for uh for assets like people don't

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.950 align:start position:0%
like people don't actually innovate all that much with

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.109 align:start position:0%
actually innovate all that much with assets

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:21.589 align:start position:0%
assets um and like i guess my question to you

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.910 align:start position:0%
um and like i guess my question to you is like can we make those like canonical

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.390 align:start position:0%
is like can we make those like canonical assets on stellar be the existing

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
assets on stellar be the existing assets

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
maybe i mean i think you'd be making a lot of

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.190 align:start position:0%
i mean i think you'd be making a lot of sacrifices to do so

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.430 align:start position:0%
sacrifices to do so are they sacrifices worth making making

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.030 align:start position:0%
are they sacrifices worth making making not to me

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.109 align:start position:0%
not to me what are the sacrifices

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.710 align:start position:0%
what are the sacrifices i mean i think the biggest sacrifice is

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.270 align:start position:0%
i mean i think the biggest sacrifice is just like do we really want to have

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.550 align:start position:0%
just like do we really want to have a 64-bit balance for everything

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.230 align:start position:0%
a 64-bit balance for everything um

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.710 align:start position:0%
um the next sacrifice is like

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.309 align:start position:0%
the next sacrifice is like do you want it to literally be exactly

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
do you want it to literally be exactly what exists today

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.150 align:start position:0%
what exists today or do you want to build on top of that

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.829 align:start position:0%
or do you want to build on top of that more because like you would need like to

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
more because like you would need like to do the stuff that's common

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
do the stuff that's common in

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
in you know d5 you would need an allowances

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.710 align:start position:0%
you know d5 you would need an allowances system on top of that anyway so it's not

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.510 align:start position:0%
system on top of that anyway so it's not what we have right now

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.589 align:start position:0%
what we have right now um

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:25.190 align:start position:0%
um we have all this compliance stuff baked

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.270 align:start position:0%
we have all this compliance stuff baked in it's pretty unwieldy for a variety of

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
in it's pretty unwieldy for a variety of reasons

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.230 align:start position:0%
reasons do we want to be married to that for the

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:42.390 align:start position:0%
do we want to be married to that for the rest of eternity i don't so

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.109 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm getting at is you can shoehorn anything into anything

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:57.190 align:start position:0%
you can shoehorn anything into anything send you

00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:03.270 align:start position:0%
i have a really strong opinion about the should you question but i do have uh

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
i participated briefly the last time around and i just want to do ads since

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
around and i just want to do ads since you're already doing requirements

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
you're already doing requirements gathering here a somewhat

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.870 align:start position:0%
gathering here a somewhat narrow version of of what feel like

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.870 align:start position:0%
narrow version of of what feel like the requirements i would want to add to

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.910 align:start position:0%
the requirements i would want to add to this question i don't actually have very

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.670 align:start position:0%
this question i don't actually have very strong opinions about the assets i do

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.670 align:start position:0%
strong opinions about the assets i do have fairly strong opinions about two

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.069 align:start position:0%
have fairly strong opinions about two minor points um and i think they i think

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.910 align:start position:0%
minor points um and i think they i think there's a wide variety of ways to

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
there's a wide variety of ways to achieve these but if we're writing

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
achieve these but if we're writing things down um if possible i would like

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
things down um if possible i would like to request that users not be in charge

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
to request that users not be in charge of non-management unless they really

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.630 align:start position:0%
of non-management unless they really really want to i think

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
really want to i think if we're in a situation where the user

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
if we're in a situation where the user has to figure out how to operate a

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
has to figure out how to operate a cryptography api safely and correctly

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.470 align:start position:0%
cryptography api safely and correctly themselves we're putting them in a very

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.030 align:start position:0%
themselves we're putting them in a very dangerous position and

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.870 align:start position:0%
dangerous position and whether we accomplish that by by

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
whether we accomplish that by by completely baking in a standardized path

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.030 align:start position:0%
completely baking in a standardized path or just having a very easy to delegate

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.790 align:start position:0%
or just having a very easy to delegate standardized path or

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.309 align:start position:0%
standardized path or even just

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
even just there's a host function that has very

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.190 align:start position:0%
there's a host function that has very simple signature that's fairly

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.030 align:start position:0%
simple signature that's fairly impossible to misuse i'm kind of okay

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.190 align:start position:0%
impossible to misuse i'm kind of okay with most of those approaches but

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.910 align:start position:0%
with most of those approaches but um cryptography apis become error-prone

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.829 align:start position:0%
um cryptography apis become error-prone really really quickly and i don't want

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:10.630 align:start position:0%
really really quickly and i don't want to surface a lot of that to users unless

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.230 align:start position:0%
to surface a lot of that to users unless they ask for it unless they're going out

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
they ask for it unless they're going out of their way to say i personally want to

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.430 align:start position:0%
of their way to say i personally want to do some some fancy cryptography for the

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.470 align:start position:0%
do some some fancy cryptography for the average person who's just creating an

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
average person who's just creating an asset i really want them to not be

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.870 align:start position:0%
asset i really want them to not be forced to copy paste and possibly get

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.230 align:start position:0%
forced to copy paste and possibly get wrong the use of a cryptography api

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.030 align:start position:0%
wrong the use of a cryptography api um

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.510 align:start position:0%
um that's requirement slash desire number

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
that's requirement slash desire number one and requirement desire number two is

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.710 align:start position:0%
one and requirement desire number two is um

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.550 align:start position:0%
um ideally if that code is gonna be in

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.230 align:start position:0%
ideally if that code is gonna be in every single contract and it's the only

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
every single contract and it's the only thing that differs from one contract to

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.390 align:start position:0%
thing that differs from one contract to another

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
another uh or or if it's if it's a if it's

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh or or if it's if it's a if it's standardized preamble in every single

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.390 align:start position:0%
standardized preamble in every single contract on every single path uh it

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.589 align:start position:0%
contract on every single path uh it would be nice just from a code size and

00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
would be nice just from a code size and execution performance perspective to

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.630 align:start position:0%
execution performance perspective to factor it out as well so i'm just

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.230 align:start position:0%
factor it out as well so i'm just i know the authorization point is not

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
i know the authorization point is not the only part of interrupt but to me

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.790 align:start position:0%
the only part of interrupt but to me it's the only part that i actually care

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.990 align:start position:0%
it's the only part that i actually care about i do not care about the other

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
about i do not care about the other aspects

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
right so i think that what you just described i think is that's kind of what

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.030 align:start position:0%
described i think is that's kind of what is uh touched on in all this

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:09.910 align:start position:0%
is uh touched on in all this uh

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.270 align:start position:0%
uh yeah in cap 52

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
the authorization model though for for uh

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
uh for payments

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.750 align:start position:0%
for payments is uh

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.990 align:start position:0%
is uh and going back to that right is it is is

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.510 align:start position:0%
and going back to that right is it is is different it's different and that's why

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
different it's different and that's why they are like things done in a certain

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.710 align:start position:0%
they are like things done in a certain way in cap 52 but i do agree that

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.710 align:start position:0%
way in cap 52 but i do agree that i know as we try to figure out like the

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.230 align:start position:0%
i know as we try to figure out like the actual

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.870 align:start position:0%
actual interrupt story with classic it would be

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
interrupt story with classic it would be we can uh

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.990 align:start position:0%
we can uh avoid having i mean having like a

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.190 align:start position:0%
avoid having i mean having like a yeah like good

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.190 align:start position:0%
yeah like good solid um

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.109 align:start position:0%
solid um base implementation that people can just

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:51.829 align:start position:0%
base implementation that people can just you know import in their in their

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
you know import in their in their thing and then just works

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
thing and then just works mostly without

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.069 align:start position:0%
mostly without having to implement those things

00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
having to implement those things and but like the the

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
and but like the the key part of that the absolute most

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
key part of that the absolute most important part of that from my

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.190 align:start position:0%
important part of that from my perspective is the authorization aspect

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.309 align:start position:0%
perspective is the authorization aspect of it

00:45:06.319 --> 00:45:07.990 align:start position:0%
of it you want to if you want to allow or

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.230 align:start position:0%
you want to if you want to allow or require people to fiddle other parts it

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.230 align:start position:0%
require people to fiddle other parts it doesn't matter quite so much but

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter quite so much but and user writing your own authorization

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:39.430 align:start position:0%
and user writing your own authorization group is just a disaster

00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:51.030 align:start position:0%
we have too many crickets can somebody make it

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:55.750 align:start position:0%
i don't like uh well i do have a question so returning to to what

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.710 align:start position:0%
question so returning to to what tomorrow

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.190 align:start position:0%
tomorrow sort of started this threat this

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.349 align:start position:0%
sort of started this threat this head where he started it which was

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:03.510 align:start position:0%
head where he started it which was just other networks have

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
just other networks have a canonical way like economical

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.790 align:start position:0%
a canonical way like economical representation of assets that people

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
representation of assets that people just use

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.349 align:start position:0%
just use his question was can you know the the

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:15.190 align:start position:0%
his question was can you know the the current or classic asset just be that

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.950 align:start position:0%
current or classic asset just be that canonical representation

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.870 align:start position:0%
canonical representation on says

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.069 align:start position:0%
on says you know

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:22.230 align:start position:0%
you know he's not a fan of that approach

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
he's not a fan of that approach the question is

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.910 align:start position:0%
is it worth trying to think about

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.190 align:start position:0%
other models that we could use for the canonical representation of an asset

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.190 align:start position:0%
canonical representation of an asset that we could discuss or is it premature

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
that we could discuss or is it premature to just to get into that right now

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:39.910 align:start position:0%
to just to get into that right now [Music]

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
[Music] i mean in a way you know you know like

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.190 align:start position:0%
i mean in a way you know you know like in cap 49 for example the the wrapped

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
in cap 49 for example the the wrapped asset is a canonical

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
asset is a canonical implementation

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.910 align:start position:0%
implementation you know of the classic asset

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
you know of the classic asset but it's actually something that is

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.069 align:start position:0%
but it's actually something that is modeled as

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:01.270 align:start position:0%
modeled as a smart asset uh so

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.550 align:start position:0%
a smart asset uh so so it's not like people would have to

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.150 align:start position:0%
so it's not like people would have to reinvent a bunch of things there you can

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.829 align:start position:0%
reinvent a bunch of things there you can actually standardize on exactly that

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:07.349 align:start position:0%
actually standardize on exactly that thing and that's actually what is

00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:09.670 align:start position:0%
thing and that's actually what is interesting about this this approach is

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.589 align:start position:0%
interesting about this this approach is that you the way you do it is you

00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:13.109 align:start position:0%
that you the way you do it is you actually

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:15.349 align:start position:0%
actually write a standard

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.829 align:start position:0%
write a standard you know like erc20 type of equivalent

00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:20.790 align:start position:0%
you know like erc20 type of equivalent you design it

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
as a as uh thinking about the semantics as smart semantics first

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.230 align:start position:0%
as smart semantics first and then you you make it uh yeah

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.309 align:start position:0%
and then you you make it uh yeah interrupt with

00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
interrupt with with classic assets and there's only one

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
with classic assets and there's only one way to do it but yeah you do have

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:53.829 align:start position:0%
way to do it but yeah you do have standardization happening in that world

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.270 align:start position:0%
i'm not so so getting back to that like i feel like i'm the only one talking

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm the only one talking like it seems to me that the

00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
like it seems to me that the standardization is not necessarily the

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.069 align:start position:0%
standardization is not necessarily the sticky point

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
sticky point because

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.069 align:start position:0%
because in all those uh proposals so far there

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:08.870 align:start position:0%
