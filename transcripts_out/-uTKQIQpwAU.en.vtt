00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.510 align:start position:0%
Hello and welcome everyone to this week's Stella developer meeting. We are

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.749 align:start position:0%
week's Stella developer meeting. We are finally back again after Meridian and

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.709 align:start position:0%
finally back again after Meridian and lots of hackathons and activities. But

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.629 align:start position:0%
lots of hackathons and activities. But I'm great to it's great to be back.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.030 align:start position:0%
I'm great to it's great to be back. And with us today we have Steve from

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
And with us today we have Steve from Open Seelin. Open Seelin. You have

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.029 align:start position:0%
Open Seelin. Open Seelin. You have probably heard about it. Maybe you've

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.550 align:start position:0%
probably heard about it. Maybe you've even tried some of their their tooling,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.830 align:start position:0%
even tried some of their their tooling, but they're building some really great

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.830 align:start position:0%
but they're building some really great tooling that's compatible with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.230 align:start position:0%
tooling that's compatible with Stellar and built for Stellar. So I'm

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.029 align:start position:0%
Stellar and built for Stellar. So I'm really excited to see a demo of the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.509 align:start position:0%
really excited to see a demo of the the latest tool that developed that

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.630 align:start position:0%
the latest tool that developed that runs the UI builder. So Steve, yeah,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.630 align:start position:0%
runs the UI builder. So Steve, yeah, maybe just introduce yourself really

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.549 align:start position:0%
maybe just introduce yourself really briefly and then yeah, we can jump

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.069 align:start position:0%
briefly and then yeah, we can jump into the demo.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.430 align:start position:0%
into the demo. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. I really

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.590 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It's nice to be here and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.430 align:start position:0%
appreciate it. It's nice to be here and to be with you all here today. So

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
to be with you all here today. So again, my name is Steve. I am doing

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.110 align:start position:0%
again, my name is Steve. I am doing developer relations with open zeppelin

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.549 align:start position:0%
developer relations with open zeppelin and so I handle a lot of things anywhere

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
and so I handle a lot of things anywhere from documentation or interacting

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.029 align:start position:0%
from documentation or interacting with a lot of our ecosystem communities

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.709 align:start position:0%
with a lot of our ecosystem communities and you know showing you guys how

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.709 align:start position:0%
and you know showing you guys how some of the stuff works and yeah I think

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.790 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff works and yeah I think it's going to be really fun.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
it's going to be really fun. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll share the screen here.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
Maybe you can zoom in a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I can do that. And my

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I can do that. And my screen is a little big. There we go. I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.710 align:start position:0%
screen is a little big. There we go. I think that should be good.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.350 align:start position:0%
think that should be good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Does that look better? Yep.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Does that look better? Yep. &gt;&gt; Sweet. Awesome. Yeah. Well, like I said,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.950 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Sweet. Awesome. Yeah. Well, like I said, today we're going to be showing off

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
today we're going to be showing off the Open Zeppelin UI builder.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.990 align:start position:0%
the Open Zeppelin UI builder. Essentially, this is a tool you can use

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.550 align:start position:0%
Essentially, this is a tool you can use to interact with contracts that you have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.550 align:start position:0%
to interact with contracts that you have on either Stellar mainet or Stellar

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
on either Stellar mainet or Stellar testnet, but it's actually goes a little

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
testnet, but it's actually goes a little bit further than that. it's honestly

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.550 align:start position:0%
bit further than that. it's honestly like a React component library, like a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.350 align:start position:0%
like a React component library, like a UI library. And so once you've created

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.270 align:start position:0%
UI library. And so once you've created these forms or got the basics going, you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.149 align:start position:0%
these forms or got the basics going, you can actually download it as an entire

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
can actually download it as an entire app or you can install the library as a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 align:start position:0%
app or you can install the library as a package and build these UI elements

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.190 align:start position:0%
package and build these UI elements yourself. And it just takes a lot of

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
yourself. And it just takes a lot of that weight off of you when you're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.190 align:start position:0%
that weight off of you when you're trying to build interactive elements,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.109 align:start position:0%
trying to build interactive elements, you know, with your contracts. So today,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.230 align:start position:0%
you know, with your contracts. So today, I'll just go ahead and show you what it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.590 align:start position:0%
I'll just go ahead and show you what it looks like. You can visit this today.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.709 align:start position:0%
looks like. You can visit this today. It's live at builder.openzeppelin.com.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.550 align:start position:0%
It's live at builder.openzeppelin.com. And you'll be landed in this, you know,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.109 align:start position:0%
And you'll be landed in this, you know, new contract UI screen. And all you have

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.229 align:start position:0%
new contract UI screen. And all you have to do is just go ahead and select the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.630 align:start position:0%
to do is just go ahead and select the stellar tab. And then you select

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.470 align:start position:0%
stellar tab. And then you select stellar test net or mainet. So I'm going

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.110 align:start position:0%
stellar test net or mainet. So I'm going to click test net right now. And from

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.710 align:start position:0%
to click test net right now. And from here we just go ahead and paste in a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
here we just go ahead and paste in a contract ID. it does work with both

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.350 align:start position:0%
contract ID. it does work with both WASM and stellar asset contracts. The

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
WASM and stellar asset contracts. The main difference is that these will pull

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.949 align:start position:0%
main difference is that these will pull directly from source, but these since

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.750 align:start position:0%
directly from source, but these since they're not you know all the API and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.270 align:start position:0%
they're not you know all the API and things like that are not with source

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.790 align:start position:0%
things like that are not with source will actually pull that from GitHub

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.030 align:start position:0%
will actually pull that from GitHub directly. But both of them work, so

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.470 align:start position:0%
directly. But both of them work, so you'll have no problem there. But we'll

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
you'll have no problem there. But we'll go ahead and pull this one in. And right

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.150 align:start position:0%
go ahead and pull this one in. And right away, you'll see that we go ahead and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.070 align:start position:0%
away, you'll see that we go ahead and pull in a whole bunch of stuff. First,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.630 align:start position:0%
pull in a whole bunch of stuff. First, we pull in the contract state here. So,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
we pull in the contract state here. So, this is the current state of the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
this is the current state of the contract. This is kind of like our we

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
contract. This is kind of like our we call it our kitchen sync contract that

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.070 align:start position:0%
call it our kitchen sync contract that has all sorts of variables and functions

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.990 align:start position:0%
has all sorts of variables and functions just to test a lot of different, you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.309 align:start position:0%
just to test a lot of different, you know, possible interactions. And we're

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.350 align:start position:0%
know, possible interactions. And we're pulling that directly from

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
pulling that directly from stellar.expert.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.110 align:start position:0%
stellar.expert. Really cool. And so, from here, we can

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
Really cool. And so, from here, we can go ahead and click next. And this is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
go ahead and click next. And this is where we start to decide or build out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
where we start to decide or build out our form. And the first thing you'll

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
our form. And the first thing you'll want to do is select a function. what

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
want to do is select a function. what do you want to build a form for? What

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.949 align:start position:0%
do you want to build a form for? What piece do you want to interact with? And

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.070 align:start position:0%
piece do you want to interact with? And there's a whole bunch of different

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.670 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of different stuff. I'm going to select something

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
stuff. I'm going to select something pretty simple, just a set text right

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.229 align:start position:0%
pretty simple, just a set text right here. So I just hit select here. And

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.229 align:start position:0%
here. So I just hit select here. And from here I can start to kind of

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.270 align:start position:0%
from here I can start to kind of customize this. So I can say like set

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
customize this. So I can say like set greeting. I can change the description,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
greeting. I can change the description, things like that. , from there I can

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.869 align:start position:0%
things like that. , from there I can go into the fields and have like field

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.430 align:start position:0%
go into the fields and have like field labels. I could do field types and you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.190 align:start position:0%
labels. I could do field types and you know if we need an email or input,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.229 align:start position:0%
know if we need an email or input, there's like a whole bunch of different

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.350 align:start position:0%
there's like a whole bunch of different types here. So I'm going to say we'll

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
types here. So I'm going to say we'll just call this greeting

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.229 align:start position:0%
just call this greeting and say placeholder hello. And there's a

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.430 align:start position:0%
and say placeholder hello. And there's a whole lot of stuff you can do like

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
whole lot of stuff you can do like required fields. You can hide from the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.670 align:start position:0%
required fields. You can hide from the UI, use hard-coded values. It's very

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.710 align:start position:0%
UI, use hard-coded values. It's very customizable. And so once we have that,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.710 align:start position:0%
customizable. And so once we have that, I'll go ahead and do an execution

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.509 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and do an execution method. So from here we can decide if we

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
method. So from here we can decide if we want to allow any wallet to connect with

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
want to allow any wallet to connect with this and start using it or if we want to

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.710 align:start position:0%
this and start using it or if we want to require like specific account to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.869 align:start position:0%
require like specific account to interact with it. We also have the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.110 align:start position:0%
interact with it. We also have the option to do open Zeppelin relayers. If

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
option to do open Zeppelin relayers. If you haven't checked out relayers, I

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.150 align:start position:0%
you haven't checked out relayers, I would highly recommend you do. You can

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.789 align:start position:0%
would highly recommend you do. You can check them out at

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.590 align:start position:0%
check them out at docs.openzeppelin.comrelayer.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.070 align:start position:0%
docs.openzeppelin.comrelayer. And essentially they're managed services

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.070 align:start position:0%
And essentially they're managed services kind of like a back-end server that can

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.230 align:start position:0%
kind of like a back-end server that can relay transactions for you and can

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.909 align:start position:0%
relay transactions for you and can automate certain things and you can do

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
automate certain things and you can do things like gasless transactions. It has

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
things like gasless transactions. It has full stellar network support. So it's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.230 align:start position:0%
full stellar network support. So it's really really cool stuff. Would highly

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.909 align:start position:0%
really really cool stuff. Would highly recommend checking it out. But for now

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
recommend checking it out. But for now we'll just stick with like a standard

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.830 align:start position:0%
we'll just stick with like a standard account. And then from there we have a

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.310 align:start position:0%
account. And then from there we have a UI kit. So you can basically choose

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.830 align:start position:0%
UI kit. So you can basically choose which wallet kit you want to be

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.390 align:start position:0%
which wallet kit you want to be included. So right now I have just the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.350 align:start position:0%
included. So right now I have just the built by Open Zeppelin standard one.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.350 align:start position:0%
built by Open Zeppelin standard one. It's kind of like a very minimal,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
It's kind of like a very minimal, nothing really fancy. So I can see my

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
nothing really fancy. So I can see my accounts connected here. I could

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.909 align:start position:0%
accounts connected here. I could disconnect. but if you wanted to, you

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
disconnect. but if you wanted to, you could also use the stellar walts kit.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
could also use the stellar walts kit. And so you'll have, you know, a

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.110 align:start position:0%
And so you'll have, you know, a different experience. You can kind of

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.870 align:start position:0%
different experience. You can kind of customize that and choose which one you

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
customize that and choose which one you like. I'll just go ahead and switch to

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.550 align:start position:0%
like. I'll just go ahead and switch to open zeppelins. And once we have

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
open zeppelins. And once we have everything ready, , I can either just

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
everything ready, , I can either just go and hit next or at any point when I'm

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.710 align:start position:0%
go and hit next or at any point when I'm in this, , you know, building phase, I

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
in this, , you know, building phase, I can hit preview form to view it and test

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.710 align:start position:0%
can hit preview form to view it and test it out and then go back to building it.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.870 align:start position:0%
it out and then go back to building it. So once we have it set, I could actually

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.189 align:start position:0%
So once we have it set, I could actually go ahead and give this a shot here. So I

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
go ahead and give this a shot here. So I can say hello world or something like

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.749 align:start position:0%
can say hello world or something like that. Go ahead and do execute. And

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
that. Go ahead and do execute. And that's just going to have me sign that

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
that's just going to have me sign that transaction.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.870 align:start position:0%
transaction. And there we go. It's successful. And

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
And there we go. It's successful. And what's really cool is that we can just

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.150 align:start position:0%
what's really cool is that we can just hit this refresh button here. And you

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.830 align:start position:0%
hit this refresh button here. And you can see we have our hello world that's

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
can see we have our hello world that's been updated in our contract state,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.629 align:start position:0%
been updated in our contract state, which is really cool. And from here, we

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.550 align:start position:0%
which is really cool. And from here, we can go ahead and export this if we want

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.830 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and export this if we want to. This is going to export it as a like

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
to. This is going to export it as a like zip folder. And once you unzip it, it's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.550 align:start position:0%
zip folder. And once you unzip it, it's going to be a V react project. And you

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.150 align:start position:0%
going to be a V react project. And you could just install the dependencies,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.390 align:start position:0%
could just install the dependencies, build, and then you basically have a app

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
build, and then you basically have a app ready to go. Now, that's only half of it

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
ready to go. Now, that's only half of it because that's like a really simple one

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.309 align:start position:0%
because that's like a really simple one form piece there. If you wanted to, you

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
form piece there. If you wanted to, you can even go to our GitHub here, which

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.830 align:start position:0%
can even go to our GitHub here, which is open zeppelini-builder.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.629 align:start position:0%
is open zeppelini-builder. And from here, you can actually download

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.150 align:start position:0%
And from here, you can actually download package dependencies. You could build

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.909 align:start position:0%
package dependencies. You could build these and use them in your app yourself,

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
these and use them in your app yourself, the components themselves. So, there's a

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.550 align:start position:0%
the components themselves. So, there's a lot there. And just to show you too

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.070 align:start position:0%
lot there. And just to show you too the some of the other things that the UI

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.230 align:start position:0%
the some of the other things that the UI builder has to offer is once we created

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
builder has to offer is once we created this UI, we can see it here under our

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.950 align:start position:0%
this UI, we can see it here under our contract UIs here. And so as you build

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.469 align:start position:0%
contract UIs here. And so as you build these forms and let's say you're doing

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.390 align:start position:0%
these forms and let's say you're doing multiple different tests or multiple

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.469 align:start position:0%
multiple different tests or multiple different forms, they're all stored in

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.710 align:start position:0%
different forms, they're all stored in your browser as local storage and you

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.309 align:start position:0%
your browser as local storage and you can actually click on them here. So,

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.469 align:start position:0%
can actually click on them here. So, here's a different one that's a much

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.309 align:start position:0%
here's a different one that's a much more complex form where I can put in an

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.390 align:start position:0%
more complex form where I can put in an account address. I can put an account

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.270 align:start position:0%
account address. I can put an account label, , key values. There's a whole

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
label, , key values. There's a whole lot of stuff you can put here. And so,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff you can put here. And so, these are all kind of stored. And if I

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.909 align:start position:0%
these are all kind of stored. And if I wanted to, I could click on the three

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.870 align:start position:0%
wanted to, I could click on the three dots here to rename, duplicate, export.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.749 align:start position:0%
dots here to rename, duplicate, export. And all of this is basically just basic

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
And all of this is basically just basic JSON data. So at any point I can

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
JSON data. So at any point I can actually export all of my current UIs

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
actually export all of my current UIs into a JSON file right here. And so from

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
into a JSON file right here. And so from there I can import it and if I ever

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.550 align:start position:0%
there I can import it and if I ever needed to bring it back or something

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.469 align:start position:0%
needed to bring it back or something like that, it's all dated. Just click

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.390 align:start position:0%
like that, it's all dated. Just click import. And it brings in those forms

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.430 align:start position:0%
import. And it brings in those forms that I just had.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.029 align:start position:0%
that I just had. And so we can just go ahead and delete

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
And so we can just go ahead and delete those.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
those. And yeah, that is the basics of the UI

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
And yeah, that is the basics of the UI builder. And again, I think it works

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.749 align:start position:0%
builder. And again, I think it works really great if you're working with our

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.589 align:start position:0%
really great if you're working with our wizard and you're like maybe putting

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.029 align:start position:0%
wizard and you're like maybe putting together a contract, maybe you've

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
together a contract, maybe you've deployed it. From here, you can just

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
deployed it. From here, you can just paste in that address, interact with it,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.749 align:start position:0%
paste in that address, interact with it, and test it out. Or if you wanted to

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.270 align:start position:0%
and test it out. Or if you wanted to build your own web app that has those

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.070 align:start position:0%
build your own web app that has those UIs built in. Yeah, that's pretty much

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
UIs built in. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
it. &gt;&gt; Great. if there's anyone that has

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.469 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Great. if there's anyone that has any questions, please feel free to to

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:05.029 align:start position:0%
any questions, please feel free to to drop them in in the comments. I think

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.710 align:start position:0%
drop them in in the comments. I think this was this was a really interesting

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.749 align:start position:0%
this was this was a really interesting demo. are there any limitations or

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
demo. are there any limitations or anything I should know as a developer?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.749 align:start position:0%
anything I should know as a developer? if what is the what what what would

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0%
if what is the what what what would be the common use case? Is it some some

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.469 align:start position:0%
be the common use case? Is it some some someone who's playing around with the

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:22.150 align:start position:0%
someone who's playing around with the UI and they can drop it into their own

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.909 align:start position:0%
UI and they can drop it into their own UI as a component or what is what what

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:27.830 align:start position:0%
UI as a component or what is what what what is a typical use case you would

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.629 align:start position:0%
what is a typical use case you would say?

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
say? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's actually a lot of

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's actually a lot of great use cases for it. One of them,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
great use cases for it. One of them, like you said, is if you're just playing

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.350 align:start position:0%
like you said, is if you're just playing around and you want to test around or

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
around and you want to test around or try out a contract, it gives it a really

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.350 align:start position:0%
try out a contract, it gives it a really easy un interface to start using it. ,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.870 align:start position:0%
easy un interface to start using it. , but we've seen some other people as well

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.949 align:start position:0%
but we've seen some other people as well where like it could be used in a team

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.949 align:start position:0%
where like it could be used in a team application like for instance to help

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.030 align:start position:0%
application like for instance to help manage liquidity pools or build more

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.110 align:start position:0%
manage liquidity pools or build more complex forms that might be used

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
complex forms that might be used internally. There's all sorts of things

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
internally. There's all sorts of things I think you can do. but I think you

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.790 align:start position:0%
I think you can do. but I think you know for people who are just starting

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
know for people who are just starting out just wanting to build and get

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
out just wanting to build and get experience I think it's great for that

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.190 align:start position:0%
experience I think it's great for that use case personally. Yeah, I I can

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
use case personally. Yeah, I I can definitely see it. developers in like

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.710 align:start position:0%
definitely see it. developers in like early in the developer journey. if

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.829 align:start position:0%
early in the developer journey. if you build a smart contract, it

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.310 align:start position:0%
you build a smart contract, it sometimes it can be a little bit

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.710 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be a little bit complicated if you're completely new to

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.269 align:start position:0%
complicated if you're completely new to Stellar to use the CLI to invoke the

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
Stellar to use the CLI to invoke the contract and get all the the formatting

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
contract and get all the the formatting correct in in the in the invoke command.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
correct in in the in the invoke command. definitely makes it a lot easier to be

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.509 align:start position:0%
definitely makes it a lot easier to be able to quickly spin up a UI and

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
able to quickly spin up a UI and interact with your smart contract and

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
interact with your smart contract and test things out. But but you said it's

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.389 align:start position:0%
test things out. But but you said it's built in it was built in React.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
built in it was built in React. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. It's all basic React UI

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. It's all basic React UI components. I think we use Shad CN UI

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.829 align:start position:0%
components. I think we use Shad CN UI components under the hood as well. so

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.509 align:start position:0%
components under the hood as well. so I think we have a lot of visions too

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.670 align:start position:0%
I think we have a lot of visions too about what that might look like in the

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.590 align:start position:0%
about what that might look like in the future and how you might be able to

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
future and how you might be able to import them into your existing app or

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.350 align:start position:0%
import them into your existing app or something like that. They are packages

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
something like that. They are packages that you can install to an existing

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
that you can install to an existing React app and just start building right

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.710 align:start position:0%
React app and just start building right away if you'd like to, which is really

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.509 align:start position:0%
away if you'd like to, which is really cool.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:01.269 align:start position:0%
cool. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it it definitely makes it easy to

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.829 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it definitely makes it easy to drop it into to if if you're building a

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.990 align:start position:0%
drop it into to if if you're building a React application, then drop in the the

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.670 align:start position:0%
React application, then drop in the the forms to interact with the with the

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.190 align:start position:0%
forms to interact with the with the smart contracts.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
smart contracts. &gt;&gt; I think personally, I think we'll see a

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think personally, I think we'll see a lot of use of this in hackathons where

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.750 align:start position:0%
lot of use of this in hackathons where you have limited time to accomplish

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
you have limited time to accomplish something. it's it's a very it's it

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
something. it's it's a very it's it looks very easy. I I had a a chance to

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.269 align:start position:0%
looks very easy. I I had a a chance to play with it yesterday and it it was

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
play with it yesterday and it it was just in a matter of minutes I had a

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
just in a matter of minutes I had a front end for my for my my smart

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.470 align:start position:0%
front end for my for my my smart contract. So

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
contract. So &gt;&gt; really really great experience. I see we

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.389 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; really really great experience. I see we have a question here.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.150 align:start position:0%
have a question here. I see it as a good starting point for

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
I see it as a good starting point for building deps for your customers to

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
building deps for your customers to interact with your C contracts. Yeah,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
interact with your C contracts. Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I I even see it. I even see it

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
I I even see it. I even see it sometimes. I I do a I in my role as a

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.750 align:start position:0%
sometimes. I I do a I in my role as a dev as as you know from from yourself,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.350 align:start position:0%
dev as as you know from from yourself, we we get to play around with a lot of

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.310 align:start position:0%
we we get to play around with a lot of new stuff.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.949 align:start position:0%
new stuff. &gt;&gt; sure do.

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; sure do. &gt;&gt; And and a lot of time just for the

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And and a lot of time just for the convenience of it. I think I think

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
convenience of it. I think I think this this could be a great way for me to

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.829 align:start position:0%
this this could be a great way for me to to test out some new features in in

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.389 align:start position:0%
to test out some new features in in smart contracts and when we try to roll

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.710 align:start position:0%
smart contracts and when we try to roll out when we roll out something new. And

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.509 align:start position:0%
out when we roll out something new. And I I like to be testing things early on,

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
I I like to be testing things early on, but I don't necessarily want to build a

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.710 align:start position:0%
but I don't necessarily want to build a whole DAP around it. So So I think I

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.389 align:start position:0%
whole DAP around it. So So I think I think this this has some some great

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.470 align:start position:0%
think this this has some some great opportunities for both people playing

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.230 align:start position:0%
opportunities for both people playing around who's experimenting, but also

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
around who's experimenting, but also building the DAPs because they can drop

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
building the DAPs because they can drop in the their the components in in their

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.710 align:start position:0%
in the their the components in in their in their Next.js or their React

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
in their Next.js or their React application.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
application. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.269 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. then there's a question does it

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.269 align:start position:0%
then there's a question does it support the new release of React which

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:40.790 align:start position:0%
support the new release of React which includes a compiler demonstrated a few

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.230 align:start position:0%
includes a compiler demonstrated a few days ago at the React Summit.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.110 align:start position:0%
days ago at the React Summit. Let me see. I think as of right now

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
Let me see. I think as of right now we might be using React 19. So probably

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
we might be using React 19. So probably close. I'd have to double check if we

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.150 align:start position:0%
close. I'd have to double check if we can actually get to using React

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.430 align:start position:0%
can actually get to using React compiler. But yeah, I'd be interested

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.190 align:start position:0%
compiler. But yeah, I'd be interested to try and see if that does work. I know

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.190 align:start position:0%
to try and see if that does work. I know that's still pretty new.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's still pretty new. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great. Any other questions?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.269 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Great. Any other questions? In the meanwhile, I will say you

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
In the meanwhile, I will say you mentioned relay relay. I think we are

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned relay relay. I think we are going to do a presentation about that

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
going to do a presentation about that in about two weeks. I think it's

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
in about two weeks. I think it's &gt;&gt; Oh, excellent.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Oh, excellent. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's on next Thursday, but

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I don't think it's on next Thursday, but I think it's in two weeks if I remember

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.430 align:start position:0%
I think it's in two weeks if I remember correctly. But we are definitely going

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.629 align:start position:0%
correctly. But we are definitely going to do a a

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:28.870 align:start position:0%
to do a a developer meeting around the relay and

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
developer meeting around the relay and have a demonstration of that. So, I'm

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.389 align:start position:0%
have a demonstration of that. So, I'm looking forward to that as well.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:34.150 align:start position:0%
looking forward to that as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah, don't miss that. That's that stuff

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.230 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't miss that. That's that stuff is pretty sweet, very helpful.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.750 align:start position:0%
is pretty sweet, very helpful. &gt;&gt; Okay, can you maybe just talk a little

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.829 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Okay, can you maybe just talk a little bit about what Relay is?

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:42.230 align:start position:0%
bit about what Relay is? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's essentially like a it's

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.310 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's essentially like a it's like a Rust backend. So, it's written in

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.829 align:start position:0%
like a Rust backend. So, it's written in Rust. It's very nice, fast, it's

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:49.509 align:start position:0%
Rust. It's very nice, fast, it's efficient, and it's very easy to set

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.670 align:start position:0%
efficient, and it's very easy to set up in my opinion. you basically clone

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.350 align:start position:0%
up in my opinion. you basically clone the repo. there's like a build

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.350 align:start position:0%
the repo. there's like a build command or a setup command you run and

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
command or a setup command you run and it creates like a single binary which

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
it creates like a single binary which you can run you know in most

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.069 align:start position:0%
you can run you know in most environments and it'll basically create

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
environments and it'll basically create like a API interface for you know

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.790 align:start position:0%
like a API interface for you know smart contract interactions. So you can

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.430 align:start position:0%
smart contract interactions. So you can basically set up accounts or re

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.509 align:start position:0%
basically set up accounts or re they're called relayers and they can

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.430 align:start position:0%
they're called relayers and they can maybe have different addresses

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.269 align:start position:0%
maybe have different addresses different permissions different you can

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.870 align:start position:0%
different permissions different you can load them up with different balances

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.509 align:start position:0%
load them up with different balances etc. And so from there you can kind of

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
etc. And so from there you can kind of make permissioned or spec particularly

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.710 align:start position:0%
make permissioned or spec particularly granted access for part particular tasks

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.190 align:start position:0%
granted access for part particular tasks you know and so there's a lot you can

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.509 align:start position:0%
you know and so there's a lot you can do with it. I think a lot of the people

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.509 align:start position:0%
do with it. I think a lot of the people have used them for like gasless

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:35.430 align:start position:0%
have used them for like gasless transactions. You can send an API

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.509 align:start position:0%
transactions. You can send an API request asking to do something. The

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:39.269 align:start position:0%
request asking to do something. The relayer will take care of it and then

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:41.190 align:start position:0%
relayer will take care of it and then you know on your actual user interface

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
you know on your actual user interface app you never had to have a user pay for

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.110 align:start position:0%
app you never had to have a user pay for gas or things like that. , but yeah,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
gas or things like that. , but yeah, it can really build a lot of that. And I

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
it can really build a lot of that. And I think there's also when you use them

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
think there's also when you use them with monitors, that's the other half of

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.629 align:start position:0%
with monitors, that's the other half of the equation there. , monitors allow

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
the equation there. , monitors allow you to listen to smart contract events

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
you to listen to smart contract events or functions or anything happening. You

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
or functions or anything happening. You they're very flexible and the really

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.670 align:start position:0%
they're very flexible and the really power comes in is like you can monitor

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.509 align:start position:0%
power comes in is like you can monitor one thing on your contract and then as a

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.350 align:start position:0%
one thing on your contract and then as a reaction use something on your relayer.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
reaction use something on your relayer. , you know, so that could be something

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.350 align:start position:0%
, you know, so that could be something like, , if somebody withdraws way too

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
like, , if somebody withdraws way too much out of a contract or is an alarming

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
much out of a contract or is an alarming amount of money, you can maybe pause the

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
amount of money, you can maybe pause the contract or you can stop certain things,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.230 align:start position:0%
contract or you can stop certain things, you can react to things. It's kind of

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.949 align:start position:0%
you can react to things. It's kind of built as both a security setup as well

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:25.590 align:start position:0%
built as both a security setup as well as, you know, just a ease of life setup

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
as, you know, just a ease of life setup to, you know, for building apps and

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
to, you know, for building apps and stuff.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.710 align:start position:0%
stuff. &gt;&gt; Okay, great. It doesn't seem like we

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. It doesn't seem like we have we have any more questions. So,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
have we have any more questions. So, I would just thank you for for the demo

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.990 align:start position:0%
I would just thank you for for the demo for the demo. It was super interesting

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
for the demo. It was super interesting to see how easy it is to set up a front

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.629 align:start position:0%
to see how easy it is to set up a front end and create front-end components for

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.230 align:start position:0%
end and create front-end components for for a smart contract.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
for a smart contract. &gt;&gt; I It's kind of tooling where it's it's

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:50.629 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I It's kind of tooling where it's it's it's it's making life a lot easier.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.110 align:start position:0%
it's it's making life a lot easier. You get something up and running

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.269 align:start position:0%
You get something up and running quicker. And one of the things that I

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
quicker. And one of the things that I always love about using tooling like

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
always love about using tooling like this is that it's gone through a lot of

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
this is that it's gone through a lot of testing. It's gone typically it's gone

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.069 align:start position:0%
testing. It's gone typically it's gone through some auditing as well. So, so

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:07.509 align:start position:0%
through some auditing as well. So, so you get a really really solid

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
you get a really really solid starting point for for your project

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.910 align:start position:0%
starting point for for your project instead of trying to build everything

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to build everything yourself. So, thank you so much and

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.269 align:start position:0%
yourself. So, thank you so much and yeah, we'll be back next week with with

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:20.310 align:start position:0%
yeah, we'll be back next week with with another great demo. and just a

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.110 align:start position:0%
another great demo. and just a reminder for everyone joining here at

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
reminder for everyone joining here at 1:30 p.m. Pacific, we have a protocol

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
1:30 p.m. Pacific, we have a protocol meeting on Discord. So, see you all

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:31.670 align:start position:0%
meeting on Discord. So, see you all there and thank you again, Steve.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
there and thank you again, Steve. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Kristen. Yeah, it's great to
