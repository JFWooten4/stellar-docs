all right everybody welcome to the stellar open protocol discussion um

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.549 align:start position:0%
stellar open protocol discussion um thanks for being here thanks to all the

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.749 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here thanks to all the panelists

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.190 align:start position:0%
panelists just a reminder the goal of these

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.109 align:start position:0%
just a reminder the goal of these meetings is to talk about and plan for

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.710 align:start position:0%
meetings is to talk about and plan for changes to upcoming versions of the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.910 align:start position:0%
changes to upcoming versions of the stellar protocol

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.310 align:start position:0%
stellar protocol specifically we go over core advancement

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.070 align:start position:0%
specifically we go over core advancement proposals caps for short

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.750 align:start position:0%
proposals caps for short which are open source specs that

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.070 align:start position:0%
which are open source specs that describe suggested new features designed

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
describe suggested new features designed to evolve the protocol to meet ecosystem

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
to evolve the protocol to meet ecosystem needs

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.709 align:start position:0%
needs so caps they have a life cycle they go

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
so caps they have a life cycle they go through various phases

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.229 align:start position:0%
through various phases discussion draft final comment period

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.069 align:start position:0%
discussion draft final comment period acceptance and implementation

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.069 align:start position:0%
acceptance and implementation before they're finalized added to a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.430 align:start position:0%
before they're finalized added to a major release of stellar core

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.350 align:start position:0%
major release of stellar core and put forward to validators who

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
and put forward to validators who ultimately decide whether or not to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
ultimately decide whether or not to accept the changes by upgrading the

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
accept the changes by upgrading the network

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.350 align:start position:0%
network so actually if all goes well today we

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.110 align:start position:0%
so actually if all goes well today we may attempt to move a cap from draft to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
may attempt to move a cap from draft to final comment period

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.389 align:start position:0%
final comment period we'll see what happens very exciting

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.069 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens very exciting procedural stuff there

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
procedural stuff there if we do we'll post a notice on the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.189 align:start position:0%
if we do we'll post a notice on the stellar dev mailing list and there's a

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
stellar dev mailing list and there's a link to that in the meeting description

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.189 align:start position:0%
link to that in the meeting description uh at which point anyone who has

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.189 align:start position:0%
uh at which point anyone who has comments or questions or suggestions

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.510 align:start position:0%
comments or questions or suggestions has one week to respond before we decide

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.030 align:start position:0%
has one week to respond before we decide to either reopen the discussion

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.870 align:start position:0%
to either reopen the discussion or mark the cap as accepted so that's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.870 align:start position:0%
or mark the cap as accepted so that's what happens if we move this cap into

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.469 align:start position:0%
what happens if we move this cap into final comment period

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.469 align:start position:0%
final comment period so last time we started the meeting with

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.670 align:start position:0%
so last time we started the meeting with personal introductions

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.270 align:start position:0%
personal introductions um but today i think we'll skip that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.789 align:start position:0%
um but today i think we'll skip that just to keep things moving along

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
just to keep things moving along all the participants are listed in the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.749 align:start position:0%
all the participants are listed in the event description so if you want to know

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.590 align:start position:0%
event description so if you want to know who's who just do a quick search

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.510 align:start position:0%
who's who just do a quick search or look at last last protocol meeting

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.749 align:start position:0%
or look at last last protocol meeting where a lot of the same participants

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.350 align:start position:0%
where a lot of the same participants there's also a q a box where you can

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
there's also a q a box where you can submit questions we probably won't go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
submit questions we probably won't go through them one by one during the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.630 align:start position:0%
through them one by one during the meeting but we do look at them

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
meeting but we do look at them they do inform our discussions and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.590 align:start position:0%
they do inform our discussions and decisions so if you have a question

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
decisions so if you have a question about what we're discussing and again

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.870 align:start position:0%
about what we're discussing and again please about what we're discussing

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.270 align:start position:0%
please about what we're discussing feel free to raise it there so fair

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.870 align:start position:0%
feel free to raise it there so fair warning this is a technical discussion

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.469 align:start position:0%
warning this is a technical discussion about a specific proposal and if you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
about a specific proposal and if you want to keep up i suggest reading

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start position:0%
want to keep up i suggest reading through the cap

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.310 align:start position:0%
through the cap which is also linked to in the meeting

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.190 align:start position:0%
which is also linked to in the meeting description that will give you context

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.910 align:start position:0%
description that will give you context now today today we will continue our

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.429 align:start position:0%
now today today we will continue our discussion from the last meeting about

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
discussion from the last meeting about cap 35

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
cap 35 which defines a method for allowing an

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
which defines a method for allowing an issuer to claw back an asset

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.149 align:start position:0%
issuer to claw back an asset in order to support regulatory

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
in order to support regulatory requirements so it can be used for

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
requirements so it can be used for instance to recover assets that have

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.190 align:start position:0%
instance to recover assets that have been fraudulently obtained

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
been fraudulently obtained to respond to regulatory actions or to

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.030 align:start position:0%
to respond to regulatory actions or to enable someone who can improve their

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.790 align:start position:0%
enable someone who can improve their identity to recover an asset in the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.030 align:start position:0%
identity to recover an asset in the event of key loss or theft

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
event of key loss or theft now remember i said we do actually pay

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
now remember i said we do actually pay attention to the qa

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.750 align:start position:0%
attention to the qa well based on some questions that came

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
well based on some questions that came in last time it seems like there's a bit

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
in last time it seems like there's a bit of confusion about this proposal

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.270 align:start position:0%
of confusion about this proposal so before we begin i just want to give a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.110 align:start position:0%
so before we begin i just want to give a quick overview to attempt to clarify a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.150 align:start position:0%
quick overview to attempt to clarify a few things

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.309 align:start position:0%
few things so based on questions that came in last

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.070 align:start position:0%
so based on questions that came in last time um

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.630 align:start position:0%
time um this is kind of what i i want to point

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.430 align:start position:0%
this is kind of what i i want to point out right

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.670 align:start position:0%
out right the proposal would introduce an optional

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.350 align:start position:0%
the proposal would introduce an optional feature for assets and it does that by

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
feature for assets and it does that by creating new authorization flags and new

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.670 align:start position:0%
creating new authorization flags and new operations to take advantage of them

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.350 align:start position:0%
operations to take advantage of them the goal is to add new functionality to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.869 align:start position:0%
the goal is to add new functionality to stellar that would make it easy

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.070 align:start position:0%
stellar that would make it easy to issue regulated assets now these new

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.070 align:start position:0%
to issue regulated assets now these new flags will have no effect on accounts

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
flags will have no effect on accounts that already hold an asset

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
that already hold an asset that means if clawback is not enabled

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.509 align:start position:0%
that means if clawback is not enabled when you obtain an asset it can't be

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
when you obtain an asset it can't be enabled for you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.470 align:start position:0%
enabled for you issuer can't just come in and change the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.470 align:start position:0%
issuer can't just come in and change the rules after the fact

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.949 align:start position:0%
rules after the fact also when an asset has clawback enabled

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
also when an asset has clawback enabled that fact will be clearly visible on the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.309 align:start position:0%
that fact will be clearly visible on the issuing account

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.229 align:start position:0%
issuing account and on the holders account in other

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
and on the holders account in other words a potential holder

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
words a potential holder will know in advance that an asset has

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
will know in advance that an asset has clawback enabled

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.390 align:start position:0%
clawback enabled they'll look at the asset they'll see

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.149 align:start position:0%
they'll look at the asset they'll see that it has clawback enabled and if they

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
that it has clawback enabled and if they decide to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.949 align:start position:0%
decide to they can hold it and they do so fully

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.190 align:start position:0%
they can hold it and they do so fully informed with eyes wide open right

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.830 align:start position:0%
informed with eyes wide open right people opt into holding these assets and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.470 align:start position:0%
people opt into holding these assets and that's a pretty

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.509 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty pretty important point um i i sort of

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.350 align:start position:0%
pretty important point um i i sort of mentioned all that just to clarify some

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.949 align:start position:0%
mentioned all that just to clarify some some some questions that came up last

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.030 align:start position:0%
some some questions that came up last time does anyone else before we dig in

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.350 align:start position:0%
time does anyone else before we dig in does anyone else have anything to add

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
are we just ready to go cool so

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.030 align:start position:0%
cool so cap 35. um the current state of this it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
cap 35. um the current state of this it is in draft mode

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.789 align:start position:0%
is in draft mode uh the question that i think we're

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
uh the question that i think we're ultimately trying to get to is is it

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
ultimately trying to get to is is it ready

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.589 align:start position:0%
ready to move into final comment period

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
to move into final comment period pending acceptance

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.630 align:start position:0%
pending acceptance but there are a couple of changes that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
but there are a couple of changes that have happened since last time

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.149 align:start position:0%
have happened since last time there are some bug fixes that address

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.589 align:start position:0%
there are some bug fixes that address comments and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
comments and there's a new set trustline's flag set

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.149 align:start position:0%
there's a new set trustline's flag set trustline flags up

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.550 align:start position:0%
trustline flags up that allows an issuer to remove clawback

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.390 align:start position:0%
that allows an issuer to remove clawback the clawback flag so

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
the clawback flag so i i i think just open up does anyone

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
i i i think just open up does anyone have any comments or questions

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.310 align:start position:0%
have any comments or questions about the changes since we last met

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
about the changes since we last met so i i think that uh the first of all i

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.950 align:start position:0%
so i i think that uh the first of all i just want to congratulate the authors i

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
just want to congratulate the authors i think it's

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.870 align:start position:0%
think it's gotten a lot better um uh

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.030 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot better um uh i have kind of like i don't know three

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.629 align:start position:0%
i have kind of like i don't know three quick comments that like maybe

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
quick comments that like maybe are just changes you can make or or not

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.469 align:start position:0%
are just changes you can make or or not and then one like

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
and then one like point for more detailed discussion so i

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.150 align:start position:0%
point for more detailed discussion so i don't know how how

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.310 align:start position:0%
don't know how how you want to go through this if we should

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.070 align:start position:0%
you want to go through this if we should start raising points or

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.070 align:start position:0%
start raising points or go around robin or what why don't you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.909 align:start position:0%
go around robin or what why don't you start with the three quick points

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.629 align:start position:0%
start with the three quick points let's just hear what those are okay so

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
let's just hear what those are okay so one again this is kind of trivial but in

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.629 align:start position:0%
one again this is kind of trivial but in this

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.790 align:start position:0%
this set trust line flags off the clear flags

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.310 align:start position:0%
set trust line flags off the clear flags and set flags or pointers and i was

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
and set flags or pointers and i was wondering

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.110 align:start position:0%
wondering why that is uh is that for future

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
why that is uh is that for future extensibility in case we have like

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.990 align:start position:0%
extensibility in case we have like multiple banks of flags or something we

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.350 align:start position:0%
multiple banks of flags or something we want to turn it into a union because

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
want to turn it into a union because otherwise

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you just have a an integer if you

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
if you just have a an integer if you zero then you're not setting any flags

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.189 align:start position:0%
zero then you're not setting any flags or clearing any flags

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
or clearing any flags so it seems like the optionality had was

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.629 align:start position:0%
so it seems like the optionality had was there's like redundant

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
there's like redundant mechanisms to not do anything i'm just

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.469 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to not do anything i'm just curious for the rationale

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
curious for the rationale so it matches uh what set options

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
so it matches uh what set options uh does right which is like if you if

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.150 align:start position:0%
uh does right which is like if you if you don't want to change clear options

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.550 align:start position:0%
you don't want to change clear options or

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.830 align:start position:0%
or like like you don't want to clear any

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.990 align:start position:0%
like like you don't want to clear any flags you can just set it to no

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.830 align:start position:0%
flags you can just set it to no right so i just follow that i don't i

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.830 align:start position:0%
right so i just follow that i don't i think your approach is fine as well

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
think your approach is fine as well uh i do think we there's an advantage in

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.350 align:start position:0%
uh i do think we there's an advantage in keeping it the same

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
keeping it the same as uh set options but sorry i thought

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.950 align:start position:0%
as uh set options but sorry i thought that instead options that actually

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
that instead options that actually actually

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
actually set the thing to a particular value

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
set the thing to a particular value whereas here we're actually setting or

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
whereas here we're actually setting or clearing bits

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.189 align:start position:0%
clearing bits so it's like a different so set options

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.350 align:start position:0%
so it's like a different so set options it is the same as set trustline flag so

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.230 align:start position:0%
it is the same as set trustline flag so i think you're thinking about allow

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.029 align:start position:0%
i think you're thinking about allow trust

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.469 align:start position:0%
trust that sets it oh right right uh so yeah

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.629 align:start position:0%
that sets it oh right right uh so yeah the goal here was to make it make it

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
the goal here was to make it make it similar to uh set options and that you

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.150 align:start position:0%
similar to uh set options and that you you control specific bits um

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.629 align:start position:0%
you control specific bits um okay well it's not it's not again this

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.230 align:start position:0%
okay well it's not it's not again this is pretty minor point i raise it it

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.590 align:start position:0%
is pretty minor point i raise it it sounds like there's a rationale so it's

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.909 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's a rationale so it's not

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
not not a huge deal um the

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
not a huge deal um the uh the other question so another

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.189 align:start position:0%
uh the other question so another question is

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.270 align:start position:0%
question is should we deprecate allow trust stop now

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
should we deprecate allow trust stop now that we have set

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.550 align:start position:0%
that we have set uh trustline flags up

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.710 align:start position:0%
i i think so i think we should uh but that would be just something to mention

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
that would be just something to mention like you know we don't have to like

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
like you know we don't have to like remove it or anything but we can just

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.990 align:start position:0%
remove it or anything but we can just deprecate it and like

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.830 align:start position:0%
deprecate it and like slowly you know eventually maybe like

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
slowly you know eventually maybe like you know way down the line remove some

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.029 align:start position:0%
you know way down the line remove some some of these obsolete

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.029 align:start position:0%
some of these obsolete operations um so third kind of

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.790 align:start position:0%
operations um so third kind of quick point or suggestion is um

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.589 align:start position:0%
quick point or suggestion is um in the set line trustline flags op

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.830 align:start position:0%
in the set line trustline flags op instead of having an asset code

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.309 align:start position:0%
instead of having an asset code should we think about putting an asset

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
should we think about putting an asset there

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.790 align:start position:0%
there and let me make the case so it's not cut

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.230 align:start position:0%
and let me make the case so it's not cut and dry but there are advantages

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
and dry but there are advantages obviously you might say well right now

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.510 align:start position:0%
obviously you might say well right now it's like completely redundant because

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's like completely redundant because the issuer should be implicit in

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.510 align:start position:0%
the issuer should be implicit in whatever the source account is for the

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.629 align:start position:0%
whatever the source account is for the operation

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.710 align:start position:0%
operation however i can imagine situations where

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
however i can imagine situations where down the line we might not want that to

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.150 align:start position:0%
down the line we might not want that to be the case and here's kind of two

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
be the case and here's kind of two scenarios where

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.990 align:start position:0%
scenarios where having the full uh asset in there would

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
having the full uh asset in there would would make this easier so one is maybe

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.870 align:start position:0%
would make this easier so one is maybe there's certain flags that like

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.189 align:start position:0%
there's certain flags that like the issuer can like add the flag or

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.870 align:start position:0%
the issuer can like add the flag or remove the flag but you can add the flag

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
remove the flag but you can add the flag or something so we actually want the

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
or something so we actually want the owner of the trust line to be able to

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
owner of the trust line to be able to change some of the flags and the issuer

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
change some of the flags and the issuer to be able to change other flags or

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
to be able to change other flags or maybe

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.589 align:start position:0%
maybe the owner can do it in one direction the

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
the owner can do it in one direction the issue or in another direction the second

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
issue or in another direction the second thing

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.589 align:start position:0%
thing which kind of comes back to this point

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
which kind of comes back to this point of feedback that i've gotten

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.790 align:start position:0%
of feedback that i've gotten a lot from talking to people which is

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.230 align:start position:0%
a lot from talking to people which is the annoying thing that if you issue a

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
the annoying thing that if you issue a bunch of assets

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.629 align:start position:0%
bunch of assets you uh and you want a fixed quantity

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.270 align:start position:0%
you uh and you want a fixed quantity that

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.550 align:start position:0%
that uh if you lock the um the high threshold

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh if you lock the um the high threshold of the account to known as high

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
of the account to known as high threshold you can no longer rotate the

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.110 align:start position:0%
threshold you can no longer rotate the keys that are used to like authorize

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.189 align:start position:0%
keys that are used to like authorize trust lines and so i don't think we want

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
trust lines and so i don't think we want to fix this today but

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.469 align:start position:0%
to fix this today but one thing that one can imagine down the

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
one thing that one can imagine down the line maybe is adding like a super user

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
line maybe is adding like a super user flag to like your trust line which

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
flag to like your trust line which allows you to

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
allows you to not only hold the asset but actually

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.029 align:start position:0%
not only hold the asset but actually authorize other people to hold the asset

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
authorize other people to hold the asset right i realized like

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.510 align:start position:0%
right i realized like maybe we do want to do this maybe we

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
maybe we do want to do this maybe we don't want to do this it means looking

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.070 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this it means looking at another

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.070 align:start position:0%
at another uh entry in the database when you're

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
uh entry in the database when you're transaction processing so there's

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.869 align:start position:0%
transaction processing so there's arguments against it but uh but but that

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.350 align:start position:0%
arguments against it but uh but but that would

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.950 align:start position:0%
would solve this problem you could like issue

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.029 align:start position:0%
solve this problem you could like issue an asset you could like create you could

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
an asset you could like create you could basically create a super user account to

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.029 align:start position:0%
basically create a super user account to to manipulate trust lines and then you

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
to manipulate trust lines and then you could completely lock the original

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.469 align:start position:0%
could completely lock the original account and then you could still rotate

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.509 align:start position:0%
account and then you could still rotate uh uh keys in the other account so

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.350 align:start position:0%
uh uh keys in the other account so just having the full asset in there

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.790 align:start position:0%
just having the full asset in there would allow us to do that because it

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.230 align:start position:0%
would allow us to do that because it would allow us this level of indirection

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
would allow us this level of indirection that a different account

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.829 align:start position:0%
that a different account could be the one uh authorizing at the

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:49.110 align:start position:0%
could be the one uh authorizing at the authorizing trust lines

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.230 align:start position:0%
authorizing trust lines and i just just to clarify you mean

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.230 align:start position:0%
and i just just to clarify you mean the asset code versus the full asset you

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
the asset code versus the full asset you mean the aztec code say usd

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
mean the aztec code say usd versus having usd colon issuer of that

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.790 align:start position:0%
versus having usd colon issuer of that asset

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.389 align:start position:0%
asset exactly exactly um and so

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly um and so the issuer is redundant because it's the

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.509 align:start position:0%
the issuer is redundant because it's the source account always but

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.269 align:start position:0%
source account always but i can imagine future situations where we

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
i can imagine future situations where we don't want to require that to be the

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.310 align:start position:0%
don't want to require that to be the case

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.230 align:start position:0%
case actually i would say i would support

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
actually i would say i would support that like originally actually in the

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.350 align:start position:0%
that like originally actually in the original proposal i didn't i didn't care

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.910 align:start position:0%
original proposal i didn't i didn't care for the clawback operation so to not

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
for the clawback operation so to not specify the

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%
specify the full uh asset

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.430 align:start position:0%
full uh asset because at the time we only had our

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.550 align:start position:0%
because at the time we only had our trust

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.870 align:start position:0%
trust but if we're going to make the change to

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.870 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to make the change to this new adult trust

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
this new adult trust like we would also make the change to

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
like we would also make the change to clawback right and then now we end up

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:38.949 align:start position:0%
clawback right and then now we end up with like

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
with like this is completely open and and in the

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
this is completely open and and in the future we can easily

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.509 align:start position:0%
future we can easily make that without having to add new

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.430 align:start position:0%
make that without having to add new operations basically

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.230 align:start position:0%
operations basically so yeah i totally support that i just

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.110 align:start position:0%
so yeah i totally support that i just want to echo this

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.910 align:start position:0%
want to echo this i've been hearing from partners uh this

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
i've been hearing from partners uh this desire to basically delegate

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.750 align:start position:0%
desire to basically delegate um um delegate the ability to allow

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.310 align:start position:0%
um um delegate the ability to allow trust

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.670 align:start position:0%
trust to separate accounts um right now

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
to separate accounts um right now we you know we we uh we

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.550 align:start position:0%
we you know we we uh we promote this idea of everyone needs to

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.470 align:start position:0%
promote this idea of everyone needs to have access to the issue or account and

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
have access to the issue or account and a low threshold but there are a lot of

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
a low threshold but there are a lot of issues with this

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
issues with this so if the issuer can actually delegate

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.750 align:start position:0%
so if the issuer can actually delegate this authority to other accounts

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.190 align:start position:0%
this authority to other accounts uh then um i think that um

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.389 align:start position:0%
uh then um i think that um is great

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
cool so i have one more issue that probably is might require more

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.790 align:start position:0%
probably is might require more discussion so i'll maybe defer if other

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
discussion so i'll maybe defer if other people have quicker things we can come

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.230 align:start position:0%
people have quicker things we can come back to the longer running ones

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.069 align:start position:0%
back to the longer running ones i think uh i thought something i want to

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
i think uh i thought something i want to comment on this is i think this is

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
comment on this is i think this is really great the idea that we can we can

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
really great the idea that we can we can in the future possibly delegate who

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.230 align:start position:0%
in the future possibly delegate who could run these operations

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
could run these operations as opposed to being the issuer i think

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.269 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being the issuer i think that

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
that that relates in some ways back to a

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
that relates in some ways back to a previous conversation we had about

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.790 align:start position:0%
previous conversation we had about clawback and the fact that

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.269 align:start position:0%
clawback and the fact that um right now clawback is only going to

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
um right now clawback is only going to return

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.670 align:start position:0%
return the asset to the issuer and there's no

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
the asset to the issuer and there's no ability to specify a destination

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.269 align:start position:0%
ability to specify a destination because i think if we if we start

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.110 align:start position:0%
because i think if we if we start thinking and i think that decision was

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
thinking and i think that decision was completely fine if we think about

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.190 align:start position:0%
completely fine if we think about clawback being something only that the

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
clawback being something only that the issuer operates

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.790 align:start position:0%
issuer operates um because if they claw something back

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.230 align:start position:0%
um because if they claw something back they can always then issue the asset

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.590 align:start position:0%
they can always then issue the asset themselves again

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.190 align:start position:0%
themselves again but when we start talking about making

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.710 align:start position:0%
but when we start talking about making it flexible enough

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.069 align:start position:0%
it flexible enough so that a delegated account could cause

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
so that a delegated account could cause the clawback

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
the clawback then the clawback is going to return to

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.949 align:start position:0%
then the clawback is going to return to the issuer um so then

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
the issuer um so then then we have that no no in that case it

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
then we have that no no in that case it would have to go back to the

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.910 align:start position:0%
would have to go back to the source account right which would be this

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
source account right which would be this uh

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
uh this other account so i think it would

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.670 align:start position:0%
this other account so i think it would be consistent with

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.030 align:start position:0%
be consistent with the behavior

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.069 align:start position:0%
okay in a in a thick attack situation you would actually not be burning uh

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:43.990 align:start position:0%
you would actually not be burning uh assets in this situation you would

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.470 align:start position:0%
assets in this situation you would actually

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
actually uh be moving assets from the account

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
uh be moving assets from the account being called back to the

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
being called back to the this kind of uh you know type of account

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.110 align:start position:0%
this kind of uh you know type of account so is the clawback mechanism set up to

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.710 align:start position:0%
so is the clawback mechanism set up to claw back to the source account

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.509 align:start position:0%
claw back to the source account currently why it's implicit right it's

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
currently why it's implicit right it's implicit okay

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.990 align:start position:0%
implicit okay i mean we could add a destination

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.509 align:start position:0%
i mean we could add a destination account so imagine a situation where

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.710 align:start position:0%
account so imagine a situation where whenever you claw back

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.150 align:start position:0%
whenever you claw back you actually want to send it to some

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.710 align:start position:0%
you actually want to send it to some like arbitrator who's gonna like decide

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.990 align:start position:0%
like arbitrator who's gonna like decide whether this is just or not

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.350 align:start position:0%
whether this is just or not or something as a way to although

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.190 align:start position:0%
or something as a way to although really you'd want to kind of force that

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
really you'd want to kind of force that so maybe that's not such a good idea i

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's not such a good idea i think it's better to have it like

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
think it's better to have it like go back to the source icon if you're the

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
go back to the source icon if you're the issuer you end up burning it and then

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.110 align:start position:0%
issuer you end up burning it and then if you want to send it to an arbitrator

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
if you want to send it to an arbitrator that's actually the second operation and

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.230 align:start position:0%
that's actually the second operation and then you do have

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.590 align:start position:0%
then you do have clear kind of separation of like

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
clear kind of separation of like what is actually happening the history

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
what is actually happening the history so it sounds like we do we do need to

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.949 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like we do we do need to change the definition

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
change the definition in the cup slightly just to be more

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.110 align:start position:0%
in the cup slightly just to be more clear that the clawback is

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.430 align:start position:0%
clear that the clawback is returning the asset to the source

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.629 align:start position:0%
returning the asset to the source account and right now the source count

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
account and right now the source count is only the issuer

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
is only the issuer um but like because i think right now

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.269 align:start position:0%
um but like because i think right now this language that talks more is more

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.710 align:start position:0%
this language that talks more is more focused on clawback

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.269 align:start position:0%
focused on clawback burning the asset rather than moving it

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
burning the asset rather than moving it so so to be clear

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
so so to be clear like in in cap 35 would not be

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.790 align:start position:0%
like in in cap 35 would not be uh like it actually doesn't make sense

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.350 align:start position:0%
uh like it actually doesn't make sense to do clawback from a

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.230 align:start position:0%
to do clawback from a non-issue icon because you know you

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.110 align:start position:0%
non-issue icon because you know you can't actually

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.829 align:start position:0%
can't actually you don't have the right to do it uh but

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:15.269 align:start position:0%
you don't have the right to do it uh but i agree in terms of wording

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:17.670 align:start position:0%
i agree in terms of wording i can actually say so second right it

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
i can actually say so second right it will just work because

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
will just work because you know adding this functionality is

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.389 align:start position:0%
you know adding this functionality is actually uh adds a bunch of complexity

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:24.629 align:start position:0%
actually uh adds a bunch of complexity uh that i don't want to do in capital e5

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.069 align:start position:0%
uh that i don't want to do in capital e5 because you have like limits and all

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
because you have like limits and all that stuff that

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.389 align:start position:0%
that stuff that the shirt doesn't have so you have like

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:34.870 align:start position:0%
the shirt doesn't have so you have like new fader modes

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.230 align:start position:0%
new fader modes and so the suggestion is just to

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.750 align:start position:0%
and so the suggestion is just to slightly tweak the language so it's

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.150 align:start position:0%
slightly tweak the language so it's clear

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
clear that while we're at it i did notice one

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
that while we're at it i did notice one really nitpicky thing which is that um

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.269 align:start position:0%
really nitpicky thing which is that um this new operation that was added

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.629 align:start position:0%
this new operation that was added recently um

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.949 align:start position:0%
recently um set trust lines flag op does appear in

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:52.150 align:start position:0%
set trust lines flag op does appear in the semantics

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
the semantics but not in the abstract so while

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.590 align:start position:0%
but not in the abstract so while someone's going to tweet that language

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.509 align:start position:0%
someone's going to tweet that language my request is please add that to the

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:02.069 align:start position:0%
my request is please add that to the abstract portion of the cap

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.470 align:start position:0%
abstract portion of the cap i can take that

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.389 align:start position:0%
cool does does anything does anyone have anything else before we

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
anything else before we take here david's more potentially

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
take here david's more potentially rabbit hole question so i have i have

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole question so i have i have one comment

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.550 align:start position:0%
one comment related to the uh the suggestion to make

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.230 align:start position:0%
related to the uh the suggestion to make the asset code an asset

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.350 align:start position:0%
the asset code an asset we uh in in the original subtraction

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.949 align:start position:0%
we uh in in the original subtraction flags proposal there was there's a

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:28.150 align:start position:0%
flags proposal there was there's a similar

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.790 align:start position:0%
similar change allowed you allowed either the

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.629 align:start position:0%
change allowed you allowed either the issuer or the owner of the trust line to

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.269 align:start position:0%
issuer or the owner of the trust line to operate on the

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.110 align:start position:0%
operate on the operation or operate on the on the

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.350 align:start position:0%
operation or operate on the on the trustline flag and one concern that came

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
trustline flag and one concern that came up

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.069 align:start position:0%
up that john brought up was that he would

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
that john brought up was that he would he preferred

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:42.629 align:start position:0%
he preferred he would prefer it if we just use a

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.470 align:start position:0%
he would prefer it if we just use a different operation for

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.829 align:start position:0%
different operation for if the owner wanted to modify the

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:48.230 align:start position:0%
if the owner wanted to modify the trustline flag uh because he

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.590 align:start position:0%
trustline flag uh because he said you know it would be it would make

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
said you know it would be it would make it would be clearer than allowing this

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
it would be clearer than allowing this like this other this brand new

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.389 align:start position:0%
like this other this brand new functionality which we don't even allow

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.230 align:start position:0%
functionality which we don't even allow at the moment right uh i

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.750 align:start position:0%
at the moment right uh i i personally i i don't think it's

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
i personally i i don't think it's it matters that much i think it's fine

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.910 align:start position:0%
it matters that much i think it's fine if we if we enable the the owner

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.509 align:start position:0%
if we if we enable the the owner of the trustline to modify a flag in the

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
of the trustline to modify a flag in the future but that that is one

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.550 align:start position:0%
future but that that is one concern that he had so that's a decision

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.069 align:start position:0%
concern that he had so that's a decision we're not taking that decision today

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.230 align:start position:0%
we're not taking that decision today like that may be perfectly fine

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.829 align:start position:0%
like that may be perfectly fine all we're saying is we're gonna leave

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:19.829 align:start position:0%
all we're saying is we're gonna leave the flexibility not otherwise we'd be

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:21.350 align:start position:0%
the flexibility not otherwise we'd be making a decision today that we have to

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.710 align:start position:0%
making a decision today that we have to do it that way and we're leaving our

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
do it that way and we're leaving our options open

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
options open that was only one of the two uses that i

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.430 align:start position:0%
that was only one of the two uses that i could think of off the top of my head of

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.870 align:start position:0%
could think of off the top of my head of having a full asset instead of the asset

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
having a full asset instead of the asset code the other one being this delegation

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.189 align:start position:0%
code the other one being this delegation which

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:34.389 align:start position:0%
which both tomer and i guess have heard uh uh

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:37.509 align:start position:0%
both tomer and i guess have heard uh uh requests for from people okay yeah i

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
requests for from people okay yeah i think that makes sense

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.150 align:start position:0%
all right david i think we're ready for your bigger question okay

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
your bigger question okay so the so the bigger question

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.629 align:start position:0%
so the so the bigger question um is and i don't know what to do about

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
um is and i don't know what to do about this

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.949 align:start position:0%
this and maybe it's not that big a deal but

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:58.069 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's not that big a deal but the the

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
the the when you when you're clawing back a

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.350 align:start position:0%
when you when you're clawing back a claimable balance

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
claimable balance um the the problem is that that whether

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.389 align:start position:0%
um the the problem is that that whether or not you can clawback a claimable

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:06.949 align:start position:0%
or not you can clawback a claimable balance

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.790 align:start position:0%
balance depends on the person who created the

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.990 align:start position:0%
depends on the person who created the claimable balance

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
claimable balance not the person who can uh redeem it

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.550 align:start position:0%
not the person who can uh redeem it right who can claim it um and this seems

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
right who can claim it um and this seems like

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
like a little bit unfortunate in terms of uh

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.269 align:start position:0%
a little bit unfortunate in terms of uh for example you know how you

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
for example you know how you arbitrate a situation where like you

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.590 align:start position:0%
arbitrate a situation where like you know i i sent you a clamo balance and

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:25.990 align:start position:0%
know i i sent you a clamo balance and then

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.590 align:start position:0%
then like i couldn't claim it anymore so i

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
like i couldn't claim it anymore so i considered it was yours but it somehow

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
considered it was yours but it somehow got

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
got clawed back before you were able to

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.350 align:start position:0%
clawed back before you were able to claim the money

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.710 align:start position:0%
claim the money um and uh and maybe you had some special

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
um and uh and maybe you had some special arrangement where like you didn't have

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
arrangement where like you didn't have clawback or

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.069 align:start position:0%
clawback or or something um so so this is

00:16:42.079 --> 00:16:44.150 align:start position:0%
or something um so so this is uh so this is bad and another thing

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.069 align:start position:0%
uh so this is bad and another thing where i think this would come a lot is

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:46.470 align:start position:0%
where i think this would come a lot is kind of

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
kind of at the end of some complicated protocol

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
at the end of some complicated protocol like a payment channel or something

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
like a payment channel or something where you kind of like at the end of the

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.749 align:start position:0%
where you kind of like at the end of the day i give you a bunch of assets and you

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.189 align:start position:0%
day i give you a bunch of assets and you give me a bunch of assets

00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
give me a bunch of assets now it's sort of like uh i would expect

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.430 align:start position:0%
now it's sort of like uh i would expect one of those

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
one of those oh you know you both either both to

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.550 align:start position:0%
oh you know you both either both to happen or neither and now there's a

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.069 align:start position:0%
happen or neither and now there's a possibility that kind of the wrong one

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
possibility that kind of the wrong one could get clawed back like my funds

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.789 align:start position:0%
could get clawed back like my funds could get caught back

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:10.230 align:start position:0%
could get caught back because you were subject uh to clawback

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.510 align:start position:0%
because you were subject uh to clawback uh but you were the one who'd like

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.069 align:start position:0%
uh but you were the one who'd like created this claimable balance

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.789 align:start position:0%
created this claimable balance so given that the claimant you know

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
so given that the claimant you know given that you can't

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.829 align:start position:0%
given that you can't you don't necessarily know who can um

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.669 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily know who can um well anyway so that that's the problem

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.829 align:start position:0%
well anyway so that that's the problem so should we do something about this and

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
so should we do something about this and do we care and if so you know what

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.350 align:start position:0%
do we care and if so you know what should we do i mean like to me that's

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.110 align:start position:0%
should we do i mean like to me that's that's that's actually why i wanted to

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.190 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually why i wanted to have this flag in the first place on the

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
have this flag in the first place on the on the balance entry because you know if

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
on the balance entry because you know if you have if you don't have

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
you have if you don't have a clawback enabled on the balanced entry

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
a clawback enabled on the balanced entry basically

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.909 align:start position:0%
basically it's uh immune to kind of interference

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:46.789 align:start position:0%
it's uh immune to kind of interference like that from

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
like that from for smart contracts yeah for the for the

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.270 align:start position:0%
for smart contracts yeah for the for the ones that do have that flag enabled i

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
ones that do have that flag enabled i agree

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
agree um uh as soon as you

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.150 align:start position:0%
um uh as soon as you as you touch it as an issuer you're

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
as you touch it as an issuer you're actually kind of blowing up a whole

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.549 align:start position:0%
actually kind of blowing up a whole smart contract and i

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:05.830 align:start position:0%
smart contract and i yeah but the problem is like it feels

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.909 align:start position:0%
yeah but the problem is like it feels like in most cases you'll be

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.909 align:start position:0%
like in most cases you'll be blowing up the wrong leg of a smart

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
blowing up the wrong leg of a smart contract

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.870 align:start position:0%
contract you don't know the problem is that you

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.669 align:start position:0%
you don't know the problem is that you don't know yeah

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.230 align:start position:0%
don't know yeah so you have to do a lot of like offline

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
so you have to do a lot of like offline type of

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.549 align:start position:0%
type of uh kind of

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
uh kind of work before actually doing this claim

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.950 align:start position:0%
work before actually doing this claim can you explain to me what the use case

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.950 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me what the use case would be in this situation

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
would be in this situation how you'd be using payment channel

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
how you'd be using payment channel payment channels

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
payment channels with claimable balances for assets that

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
with claimable balances for assets that had clawback enabled

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:40.710 align:start position:0%
had clawback enabled like is this something that there's that

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.470 align:start position:0%
like is this something that there's that a reasonable person would be using these

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.150 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person would be using these assets in that way sure i mean

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.029 align:start position:0%
assets in that way sure i mean this like whether or not you want to use

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
this like whether or not you want to use the payment channel on an asset should

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.350 align:start position:0%
the payment channel on an asset should be

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.190 align:start position:0%
be kind of independent of whether you can

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.789 align:start position:0%
kind of independent of whether you can claw it back or not

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
claw it back or not um but uh but the point is that like

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.710 align:start position:0%
um but uh but the point is that like most in most of these protocols you kind

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.710 align:start position:0%
most in most of these protocols you kind of assume that the funds are yours once

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.190 align:start position:0%
of assume that the funds are yours once you can

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.230 align:start position:0%
you can claim them um and we're now slightly

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
claim them um and we're now slightly changing that

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.070 align:start position:0%
changing that situation and that like they they could

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.270 align:start position:0%
situation and that like they they could still get clawed back because of

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.029 align:start position:0%
still get clawed back because of something bad that the issuer did even

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.150 align:start position:0%
something bad that the issuer did even if the recipient

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.990 align:start position:0%
if the recipient has some kind of a non-clawback

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.669 align:start position:0%
has some kind of a non-clawback agreement with the issuer

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:21.430 align:start position:0%
that would be on the recipient's account right

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
right on their trustline flags so like the

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:25.590 align:start position:0%
on their trustline flags so like the sender and the recipient both have

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.909 align:start position:0%
sender and the recipient both have this clawback flag they can be set or

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
this clawback flag they can be set or onset in their trust line

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
onset in their trust line so if the recipient doesn't have it set

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
so if the recipient doesn't have it set in their trust line then they know ahead

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.909 align:start position:0%
in their trust line then they know ahead of time that

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
of time that it can't be changed for them um right

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.830 align:start position:0%
it can't be changed for them um right except that

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.430 align:start position:0%
except that except that they're the the claimable

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.110 align:start position:0%
except that they're the the claimable balance that they can claim

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
balance that they can claim can be uh clawed back uh unless i'm

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.990 align:start position:0%
can be uh clawed back uh unless i'm misunderstanding

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:52.230 align:start position:0%
right and only if it has the flag only if the sender had the flag enabled right

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
if the sender had the flag enabled right so in a way it's like you wish that the

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.669 align:start position:0%
so in a way it's like you wish that the policy had to do with the recipient

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
policy had to do with the recipient rather than the sender i guess

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.909 align:start position:0%
rather than the sender i guess is is kind of what i'm saying but but

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:01.350 align:start position:0%
is is kind of what i'm saying but but that also doesn't work right because you

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.070 align:start position:0%
that also doesn't work right because you don't want to

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
don't want to just be you i shouldn't be able to like

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.430 align:start position:0%
just be you i shouldn't be able to like protect my funds by like sending them

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.549 align:start position:0%
protect my funds by like sending them all making a bunch of

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
all making a bunch of you know claimable balances that people

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
you know claimable balances that people can't claim and then reclaiming them

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.870 align:start position:0%
can't claim and then reclaiming them afterwards so i don't know what the

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.310 align:start position:0%
afterwards so i don't know what the solution is it just

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
solution is it just it seems like it's something slightly uh

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.630 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's something slightly uh annoying recipients

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
annoying recipients recipients also don't have to exist at

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.669 align:start position:0%
recipients also don't have to exist at the time the claim will balance yeah

00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:20.149 align:start position:0%
the time the claim will balance yeah exactly

00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly so there's a lot but there's no

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:31.029 align:start position:0%
exactly so there's a lot but there's no guarantee we even have that information

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
i think the only the only things we can guarantee exists on the network when the

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.149 align:start position:0%
guarantee exists on the network when the claim balance is created is that the

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:36.789 align:start position:0%
claim balance is created is that the issuer

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
issuer exists and the the account holder exists

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.990 align:start position:0%
exists and the the account holder exists the original account the sender exists

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.470 align:start position:0%
the original account the sender exists um and i think if we were to choose from

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
um and i think if we were to choose from one or the other where to get that

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.190 align:start position:0%
one or the other where to get that information from the sender is better

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.190 align:start position:0%
information from the sender is better because if we use the issuer then

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
because if we use the issuer then if the issuer enables clawback then a

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.310 align:start position:0%
if the issuer enables clawback then a sender

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.990 align:start position:0%
sender whenever they create a claim or balance

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.830 align:start position:0%
whenever they create a claim or balance it's become going to become clawback

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
it's become going to become clawback enabled even though they maybe have an

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.029 align:start position:0%
enabled even though they maybe have an agreement with the issuer

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:01.350 align:start position:0%
agreement with the issuer that when they hold the asset it isn't

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:15.190 align:start position:0%
that when they hold the asset it isn't can't be called back

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:18.789 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is what what does this

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.470 align:start position:0%
this where does this conversation lead what

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
where does this conversation lead what what action needs to be

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.950 align:start position:0%
what action needs to be taken to sort of resolve this issue

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.750 align:start position:0%
taken to sort of resolve this issue i mean you know maybe we can't resolve

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.350 align:start position:0%
i mean you know maybe we can't resolve it right maybe it's just

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.789 align:start position:0%
it right maybe it's just um uh yeah

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:35.750 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah you know it's not there there doesn't

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
you know it's not there there doesn't seem to be any ideal solution here

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:40.710 align:start position:0%
seem to be any ideal solution here and you know i agree that it's it's kind

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.110 align:start position:0%
and you know i agree that it's it's kind of at least as reasonable to have

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.710 align:start position:0%
of at least as reasonable to have the flag and a claimable balance be

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.630 align:start position:0%
the flag and a claimable balance be based on the sender than

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.710 align:start position:0%
based on the sender than to have it be based on the issuer so if

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.230 align:start position:0%
to have it be based on the issuer so if the given that those are

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.990 align:start position:0%
the given that those are kind of the only two options i can see

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
kind of the only two options i can see on the table

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
on the table um maybe we just live with it

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.909 align:start position:0%
um maybe we just live with it the spec currently specify using the

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:01.350 align:start position:0%
the spec currently specify using the sender

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
sender i can't remember it is yeah in

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
i can't remember it is yeah in everything the

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
everything the yeah okay so that's the standard because

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.029 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that's the standard because that way like

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.470 align:start position:0%
that way like like the reason i wanted that in the

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.789 align:start position:0%
like the reason i wanted that in the first place was because if you're

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:14.789 align:start position:0%
first place was because if you're going to engage in a payment channel

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
going to engage in a payment channel let's say at the beginning like you can

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
let's say at the beginning like you can actually look at those flags

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
actually look at those flags that people have on their trust lines

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.909 align:start position:0%
that people have on their trust lines and decide at this point

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
and decide at this point you actually want to basically take the

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.990 align:start position:0%
you actually want to basically take the risk or not

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.029 align:start position:0%
risk or not uh in that payment channel right

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.029 align:start position:0%
uh in that payment channel right if people don't have the flag set you

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.789 align:start position:0%
if people don't have the flag set you know that basically you're taking a zero

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
know that basically you're taking a zero risk

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
risk if you have the flag then you have a

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.830 align:start position:0%
if you have the flag then you have a question

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
question um i don't see but the flag can change

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.990 align:start position:0%
um i don't see but the flag can change like during the execution of a protocol

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
like during the execution of a protocol right so you no no no no

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.270 align:start position:0%
right so you no no no no that's the point is that if the flag

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.510 align:start position:0%
that's the point is that if the flag once you have if you have the flag

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.789 align:start position:0%
once you have if you have the flag not set people cannot uh like issue i

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:55.990 align:start position:0%
not set people cannot uh like issue i cannot set it back

00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
it can only be on set okay that's a that makes it

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.669 align:start position:0%
makes it that's that's why this this works right

00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:04.149 align:start position:0%
that's that's why this this works right like if we are allowing the issuer to

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:07.029 align:start position:0%
like if we are allowing the issuer to to basically renege on the on this it

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
to basically renege on the on this it also breaks that so that

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.909 align:start position:0%
yeah so so anyone would be up they would understand

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.909 align:start position:0%
understand this fact they would opt in to choosing

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.070 align:start position:0%
this fact they would opt in to choosing to use the asset in that way

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.070 align:start position:0%
to use the asset in that way again eyes wide open yeah like but here

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.350 align:start position:0%
again eyes wide open yeah like but here the important bit is like you can

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
the important bit is like you can imagine having

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.909 align:start position:0%
imagine having some accounts on the network that don't

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:25.909 align:start position:0%
some accounts on the network that don't have that flag enabled even though it is

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:26.310 align:start position:0%
have that flag enabled even though it is uh

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.710 align:start position:0%
uh like the issuer has the callback enabled

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.070 align:start position:0%
like the issuer has the callback enabled but they're like

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
but they're like you know maybe privileged accounts or

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.909 align:start position:0%
you know maybe privileged accounts or something like you know better cheers

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:36.710 align:start position:0%
something like you know better cheers basically of accounts that can actually

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
basically of accounts that can actually engage into those uh payment channels

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
engage into those uh payment channels or whatever i like to yeah i agree that

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.190 align:start position:0%
or whatever i like to yeah i agree that it's not ideal because

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.350 align:start position:0%
it's not ideal because like really what you would want is like

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.310 align:start position:0%
like really what you would want is like any

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
any any asset i mean any account should be

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
any asset i mean any account should be able to

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.269 align:start position:0%
able to to participate to payment channels but

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.630 align:start position:0%
to participate to payment channels but like

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
like the thing is that as soon as you you

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.070 align:start position:0%
the thing is that as soon as you you potentially have this third party kind

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.269 align:start position:0%
potentially have this third party kind of interfering

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
of interfering uh it gets really complicated

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.630 align:start position:0%
uh it gets really complicated uh i don't see yeah so i i can basically

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.230 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see yeah so i i can basically live with it i think you guys have

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.230 align:start position:0%
live with it i think you guys have convinced me that this is probably fine

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.990 align:start position:0%
convinced me that this is probably fine and uh anything else is going to be

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.310 align:start position:0%
and uh anything else is going to be worse

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.230 align:start position:0%
worse i i think i also want to mention i think

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.990 align:start position:0%
i i think i also want to mention i think this is a limitation of claimable

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
this is a limitation of claimable balances in general in the

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
balances in general in the claimant balances the only the only

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.870 align:start position:0%
claimant balances the only the only place they can go

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
place they can go is into the account is into a claim

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
is into the account is into a claim is into the an account that's defined as

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
is into the an account that's defined as a claimant

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
a claimant um and so for their use in smart

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
um and so for their use in smart contracts there's that limitation

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
contracts there's that limitation already

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.029 align:start position:0%
already um and may like maybe there's room for

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
um and may like maybe there's room for improvement

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
improvement in the future for claimable balances to

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.710 align:start position:0%
in the future for claimable balances to have other destinations

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.310 align:start position:0%
have other destinations so you know you could take funds from a

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.470 align:start position:0%
so you know you could take funds from a claim balance and move them into another

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.990 align:start position:0%
claim balance and move them into another claim will balance all into multiple

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
claim will balance all into multiple claimable balances and if you know if

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.029 align:start position:0%
claimable balances and if you know if that is ever a possibility in the future

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:53.669 align:start position:0%
that is ever a possibility in the future you know that opens up more flexibility

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
you know that opens up more flexibility for

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.269 align:start position:0%
for smart contracts um because

00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:59.029 align:start position:0%
smart contracts um because um you know then we can start talking

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.789 align:start position:0%
um you know then we can start talking about you know they can inherit

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.549 align:start position:0%
about you know they can inherit the attributes of their previous kind of

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
the attributes of their previous kind of balances or different things like that

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.070 align:start position:0%
balances or different things like that um but that's i think that's like that's

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
um but that's i think that's like that's off topic a bit but

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
off topic a bit but i think there is some limitation that

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.789 align:start position:0%
i think there is some limitation that we're inheriting from the fact that

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:13.990 align:start position:0%
we're inheriting from the fact that claimable balances

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
claimable balances only have accounts as a destination

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.110 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm satisfied nothing needs to change in the in the cap

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.830 align:start position:0%
change in the in the cap basically after this so the one there's

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
basically after this so the one there's basically one minor change which is to

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
basically one minor change which is to replace the asset

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.269 align:start position:0%
replace the asset code with that oh sorry i meant for the

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:34.630 align:start position:0%
code with that oh sorry i meant for the last part of the decision

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.549 align:start position:0%
last part of the decision sounds like for the other one we agreed

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:38.310 align:start position:0%
sounds like for the other one we agreed that we'll add a note that

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.110 align:start position:0%
that we'll add a note that allow trust stop is deprecated and we

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
allow trust stop is deprecated and we will um

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.350 align:start position:0%
will um we will add to turn the ass in two

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
we will add to turn the ass in two places we'll turn an asset code into an

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.190 align:start position:0%
places we'll turn an asset code into an asset i guess right

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
that's correct i think those are the changes that we've suggested making does

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.549 align:start position:0%
changes that we've suggested making does it does that seem accurate to everyone

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:59.430 align:start position:0%
it does that seem accurate to everyone else

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
yeah and if so those feel like pretty correct me if i'm wrong sid for instance

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.870 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong sid for instance those feel like pretty minor

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.430 align:start position:0%
those feel like pretty minor changes to execute is that correct yeah

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
changes to execute is that correct yeah they should be

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.230 align:start position:0%
they should be like that like we could move this into

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.669 align:start position:0%
like that like we could move this into final comment period pinning those

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
final comment period pinning those changes

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.190 align:start position:0%
changes does that seem correct yeah

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.669 align:start position:0%
all right guys i i say we uh i say we move this from draft and final comment

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:24.630 align:start position:0%
move this from draft and final comment period

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
period um i kind of want to do like a formal

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.430 align:start position:0%
um i kind of want to do like a formal process here we have to say i or

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.710 align:start position:0%
process here we have to say i or nay um so let's do that let's do that

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.750 align:start position:0%
nay um so let's do that let's do that uh nico

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.110 align:start position:0%
yes sid yes david

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
chalmer yes eric yep is that uh is that everybody

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.269 align:start position:0%
yep is that uh is that everybody i think that's everybody who's on this

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:54.230 align:start position:0%
i think that's everybody who's on this call guys i actually have a gavel

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.230 align:start position:0%
call guys i actually have a gavel so i'm going to strike this gavel and

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.669 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to strike this gavel and can you see it and

00:26:57.679 --> 00:26:59.669 align:start position:0%
can you see it and and now it's officially moved into uh

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
and now it's officially moved into uh final comment period

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.549 align:start position:0%
final comment period i happen to have that gavel in this room

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.549 align:start position:0%
i happen to have that gavel in this room full of junk i did not go buy it

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:08.230 align:start position:0%
full of junk i did not go buy it especially for this i promise um and so

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.909 align:start position:0%
especially for this i promise um and so that's mostly it i mean the only other

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.909 align:start position:0%
that's mostly it i mean the only other thing that i guess we could do

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:14.230 align:start position:0%
thing that i guess we could do uh which we can also decide not to do is

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.310 align:start position:0%
uh which we can also decide not to do is we could talk a bit about where this cap

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
we could talk a bit about where this cap is because i know that some

00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:20.389 align:start position:0%
is because i know that some implementation has already been done

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:22.230 align:start position:0%
implementation has already been done um do you want to walk us does anyone

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.269 align:start position:0%
um do you want to walk us does anyone want to walk us through that or should

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
want to walk us through that or should we just

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:26.470 align:start position:0%
we just be happy with this sort of procedural

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
be happy with this sort of procedural vote that we just had and

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
vote that we just had and close the meeting i think that's

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
close the meeting i think that's probably enough for now

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.389 align:start position:0%
probably enough for now like in the context of this meeting okay

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
like in the context of this meeting okay cool meetings that end early are great

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:36.710 align:start position:0%
cool meetings that end early are great there's

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.230 align:start position:0%

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
just no reason to stretch out to the full time if you're done
