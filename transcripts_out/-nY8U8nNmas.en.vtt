00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.870 align:start position:0%
Hi and welcome to this week's Stella developer meeting with me in the studio

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.350 align:start position:0%
developer meeting with me in the studio here. Today I have Fernando from dop

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.310 align:start position:0%
here. Today I have Fernando from dop protocol and I can't exactly remember

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.269 align:start position:0%
protocol and I can't exactly remember when I heard about dop protocol for the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.990 align:start position:0%
when I heard about dop protocol for the first time but I do remember I noticed

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
first time but I do remember I noticed that my feeds in all social media like

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
that my feeds in all social media like LinkedIn X anywhere this company just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
LinkedIn X anywhere this company just started to pop up and there was articles

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
started to pop up and there was articles and they were going to conferences and I

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.870 align:start position:0%
and they were going to conferences and I just just got really curious about

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
just just got really curious about what's up with these guys what are they

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
what's up with these guys what are they doing so and and of course they were

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
doing so and and of course they were attacking Stellar in everything they

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.350 align:start position:0%
attacking Stellar in everything they were doing being awesome ambassadors. So

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.549 align:start position:0%
were doing being awesome ambassadors. So I started to to read a little bit up on

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.869 align:start position:0%
I started to to read a little bit up on what they're doing and since then I've

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.470 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and since then I've had the pleasure of meeting the the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure of meeting the the whole team several times last last

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
whole team several times last last time actually this week in Silicon

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.069 align:start position:0%
time actually this week in Silicon Valley where I met Oscar but met the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.310 align:start position:0%
Valley where I met Oscar but met the team also at Meridian many other

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.310 align:start position:0%
team also at Meridian many other places. So I think it's a great

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.310 align:start position:0%
places. So I think it's a great opportunity to have them here in the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.869 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have them here in the studio and and hear what they're up to,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.630 align:start position:0%
studio and and hear what they're up to, what they're doing and and share with

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.550 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and and share with the rest of the community. So welcome

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.990 align:start position:0%
the rest of the community. So welcome Fernando and thank you for joining

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
Fernando and thank you for joining today.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
today. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for the invitation Ken.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.270 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for the invitation Ken. I'm pleasure to be here. so should I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.149 align:start position:0%
I'm pleasure to be here. so should I just now continue with the presentation?

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
just now continue with the presentation? &gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe maybe just just tell a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.670 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe maybe just just tell a little bit about who you are, how

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.429 align:start position:0%
little bit about who you are, how long how long time you've been working

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.190 align:start position:0%
long how long time you've been working on protocol.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
on protocol. &gt;&gt; A bit of an introduction. I'm

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.149 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; A bit of an introduction. I'm Fernando Castillo. I'm currently the CTO

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.910 align:start position:0%
Fernando Castillo. I'm currently the CTO of DOP protocol, one of the co-founders

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
of DOP protocol, one of the co-founders and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.149 align:start position:0%
and our main goal now with the protocol

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.149 align:start position:0%
our main goal now with the protocol is to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.950 align:start position:0%
is to be able to all of the infrastructure

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
be able to all of the infrastructure that's not being funded to get funded

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
that's not being funded to get funded by decentralized means. And now in

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.709 align:start position:0%
by decentralized means. And now in this presentation

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.069 align:start position:0%
this presentation hopefully I'm going to show a way on

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'm going to show a way on how we can do that with doken studio

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.670 align:start position:0%
how we can do that with doken studio and with the other tools we've been

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
and with the other tools we've been developing.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.949 align:start position:0%
developing. So first yeah what's the team a

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
So first yeah what's the team a bit of also an introduction

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
bit of also an introduction car and already mentioned Oscar he's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.710 align:start position:0%
car and already mentioned Oscar he's our CEO he's currently at Silicon

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
our CEO he's currently at Silicon Valley doing the embark pro program

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.070 align:start position:0%
Valley doing the embark pro program with Deron University in conjunction

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.309 align:start position:0%
with Deron University in conjunction with Stellar

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.830 align:start position:0%
with Stellar also we have Simone Spinola who's our

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.229 align:start position:0%
also we have Simone Spinola who's our operation and business officer and

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.830 align:start position:0%
operation and business officer and myself as I said already and also as a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
myself as I said already and also as a side note I'm finishing my PhD until

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.630 align:start position:0%
side note I'm finishing my PhD until Berlin now I'm in Germany currently so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.150 align:start position:0%
Berlin now I'm in Germany currently so it's a bit late for me now it's 10

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.509 align:start position:0%
it's a bit late for me now it's 10 p.m. But I'm happy to be here and

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.869 align:start position:0%
p.m. But I'm happy to be here and yeah so what's the the problem that we

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so what's the the problem that we are facing is that in Latin America

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.589 align:start position:0%
are facing is that in Latin America there are a lot of infrastructure

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of infrastructure operators that are lacking fund and they

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.910 align:start position:0%
operators that are lacking fund and they struggle to to scale because on

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.949 align:start position:0%
struggle to to scale because on traditional banking systems the they

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.390 align:start position:0%
traditional banking systems the they require to go to to ask to the bank to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
require to go to to ask to the bank to then request for a loan then go through

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.070 align:start position:0%
then request for a loan then go through all the bureaucracy of the bank. but

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.949 align:start position:0%
all the bureaucracy of the bank. but then also time moves and they need

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
then also time moves and they need the the money to deploy and to create

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
the the money to deploy and to create this new infrastructure that is not

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.509 align:start position:0%
this new infrastructure that is not risky by itself but maybe the banks

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.789 align:start position:0%
risky by itself but maybe the banks consider is risky because of the type of

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.589 align:start position:0%
consider is risky because of the type of size of the company maybe or the type of

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
size of the company maybe or the type of emerging market. So it's but it's not

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.110 align:start position:0%
emerging market. So it's but it's not that the business business itself of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
that the business business itself of that infrastructure is non

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.710 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure is non investable or that it will give money

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.470 align:start position:0%
investable or that it will give money returns.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
returns. So as I was saying let's imagine that

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.789 align:start position:0%
So as I was saying let's imagine that you are Mariano you are trying to get a

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.949 align:start position:0%
you are Mariano you are trying to get a traditional credit a loan for for a

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.229 align:start position:0%
traditional credit a loan for for a bank. but this depending on the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.030 align:start position:0%
bank. but this depending on the country also for example we've recently

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.070 align:start position:0%
country also for example we've recently seen in Argentina how this country

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
seen in Argentina how this country was facing high inflation rates or

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.510 align:start position:0%
was facing high inflation rates or similar situation with Venezuela

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
similar situation with Venezuela and other countries in Latin America

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
and other countries in Latin America with high inflation rates that then

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.909 align:start position:0%
with high inflation rates that then this ties those loans to higher interest

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.310 align:start position:0%
this ties those loans to higher interest rates plus the the risk on the country

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
rates plus the the risk on the country itself.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
itself. so there's this problem of banks

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
so there's this problem of banks because of these situations not

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.350 align:start position:0%
because of these situations not giving beneficial loans to

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.909 align:start position:0%
giving beneficial loans to to these infrastructure operators and

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.070 align:start position:0%
to these infrastructure operators and at the same time if the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.870 align:start position:0%
at the same time if the infrastructure operator would go for

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.870 align:start position:0%
infrastructure operator would go for example for a crowdfunding or a regular

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.510 align:start position:0%
example for a crowdfunding or a regular crowdfunding solution where they

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.790 align:start position:0%
crowdfunding solution where they could go online and then they could say

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.629 align:start position:0%
could go online and then they could say okay let's get all of these people

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
okay let's get all of these people request this this this amount of

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.510 align:start position:0%
request this this this amount of money. I don't know, let's ask for $100

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
money. I don't know, let's ask for $100 ,000

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
,000 so we can build this power grid based

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.510 align:start position:0%
so we can build this power grid based on on solar power. Then how then this

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
on on solar power. Then how then this operator could return or distribute

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.590 align:start position:0%
operator could return or distribute the revenue that this energy production

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.230 align:start position:0%
the revenue that this energy production is generating?

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.070 align:start position:0%
is generating? and how could they do it in a trust

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.189 align:start position:0%
and how could they do it in a trust trustworthy fashion. So all of the

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.909 align:start position:0%
trustworthy fashion. So all of the all of the people that were investing or

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.550 align:start position:0%
all of the people that were investing or supporting the project

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.230 align:start position:0%
supporting the project can can give the the the money back

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
can can give the the the money back or the the investment. And just as a

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.950 align:start position:0%
or the the investment. And just as a parenthesis latam infra operators are

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.749 align:start position:0%
parenthesis latam infra operators are Latin American infrastructure operators.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
Latin American infrastructure operators. They are for example medium to small

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
They are for example medium to small companies

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.189 align:start position:0%
companies that have this infrastructure

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.029 align:start position:0%
that have this infrastructure projects. For example, a small or not so

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.230 align:start position:0%
projects. For example, a small or not so small but maybe a few kilowatts

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
small but maybe a few kilowatts or 100 kilowatts of power into

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.790 align:start position:0%
or 100 kilowatts of power into injecting into the energy grid. for

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.029 align:start position:0%
injecting into the energy grid. for example, a solar base or holic

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.390 align:start position:0%
example, a solar base or holic or there could be other type of

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.110 align:start position:0%
or there could be other type of infrastructure for example a data

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.110 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for example a data center or any type of infrastructure

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.590 align:start position:0%
center or any type of infrastructure that's not relying on a on a big

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.070 align:start position:0%
that's not relying on a on a big company because big companies

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.749 align:start position:0%
company because big companies they wouldn't have this type of

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.510 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have this type of problem to to access credits or loans

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.590 align:start position:0%
problem to to access credits or loans from banks.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.909 align:start position:0%
from banks. so in our or what are we proposing as

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.270 align:start position:0%
so in our or what are we proposing as a solution we have this separated in in

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.150 align:start position:0%
a solution we have this separated in in four steps. One is to provide a tool

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.629 align:start position:0%
four steps. One is to provide a tool for the operator

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
for the operator to hand out verifiable data from

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.510 align:start position:0%
to hand out verifiable data from their existing

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.870 align:start position:0%
their existing company or projects. So they can for

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.390 align:start position:0%
company or projects. So they can for example validate okay this solar

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.749 align:start position:0%
example validate okay this solar solar cell is going to produce this

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
solar cell is going to produce this amount of energy because it has this

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.189 align:start position:0%
amount of energy because it has this specifications.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.270 align:start position:0%
specifications. I can I have already bought them for

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.390 align:start position:0%
I can I have already bought them for this price or I have this revenue

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
this price or I have this revenue evidence for similar

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.430 align:start position:0%
evidence for similar infrastructure

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
infrastructure pictures or proof of location for

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
pictures or proof of location for example for where is it installed the

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.830 align:start position:0%
example for where is it installed the the infrastructure

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.710 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and that that's the first part of okay

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
and that that's the first part of okay how can we give some some

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.589 align:start position:0%
how can we give some some due diligence for example that's the

00:07:57.599 --> 00:07:59.670 align:start position:0%
due diligence for example that's the same thing that the bank would go when

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
same thing that the bank would go when when this person goes to the bank. Okay,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
when this person goes to the bank. Okay, show me the papers. How can I I know

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
show me the papers. How can I I know that you are not going to ask for the

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
that you are not going to ask for the money for an an madeup project, but

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.469 align:start position:0%
money for an an madeup project, but it's a real project and you're a real

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
it's a real project and you're a real company that was not just created

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.909 align:start position:0%
company that was not just created yesterday.

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:21.749 align:start position:0%
yesterday. Then all of this information is

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:26.950 align:start position:0%
Then all of this information is naturally audited and revised by

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
naturally audited and revised by by automated process that are human le.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
by automated process that are human le. what does that mean? it means that

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.350 align:start position:0%
what does that mean? it means that we check for example okay this is a

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
we check for example okay this is a receipt but it has a digital

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.029 align:start position:0%
receipt but it has a digital signature. So it's not that this

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
signature. So it's not that this invoice for example you get from from

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.350 align:start position:0%
invoice for example you get from from another company paying for your service

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
another company paying for your service or for your infrastructure

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
or for your infrastructure is is making this up but at least

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.949 align:start position:0%
is is making this up but at least it's on on the record it's on the ledger

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:58.949 align:start position:0%
it's on on the record it's on the ledger of the tax offices for example or or the

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:00.790 align:start position:0%
of the tax offices for example or or the corresponding

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.710 align:start position:0%
corresponding regulatory

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
regulatory office in charge of of invoice

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
office in charge of of invoice and then so they they cannot be

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
and then so they they cannot be made up and the same with the with the

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
made up and the same with the with the revenues or how other distribution

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.389 align:start position:0%
revenues or how other distribution processes have been made.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
And then so and and the and the third part is okay how can we then get this

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
part is okay how can we then get this decentralized funding into the hands

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.310 align:start position:0%
decentralized funding into the hands of Mariano the one that was asking for

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
of Mariano the one that was asking for the funding. So for this is where we

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.310 align:start position:0%
the funding. So for this is where we have the smart contracts that take care

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.949 align:start position:0%
have the smart contracts that take care of this operation where the

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.389 align:start position:0%
of this operation where the supporters for the project can support

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
supporters for the project can support Mariano's infrastructure project and

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
Mariano's infrastructure project and then he can gets the fund to install

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.590 align:start position:0%
then he can gets the fund to install or do the setup for their for their

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.670 align:start position:0%
or do the setup for their for their project. Then the same once

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.190 align:start position:0%
project. Then the same once Mariano needs or is going to pay back

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.310 align:start position:0%
Mariano needs or is going to pay back with the corresponding interest to their

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
with the corresponding interest to their supporters

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.110 align:start position:0%
supporters then the smart contract also takes care

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.509 align:start position:0%
then the smart contract also takes care of that with a decentralized

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.990 align:start position:0%
of that with a decentralized distribution that's transparent and it's

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.269 align:start position:0%
distribution that's transparent and it's auditable for all of the stakeholders.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.190 align:start position:0%
And this is currently on on a suite that we're calling DO token studio.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.710 align:start position:0%
that we're calling DO token studio. There

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.470 align:start position:0%
There basically we have two two types of

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.949 align:start position:0%
basically we have two two types of users. now we're thinking of a third

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.829 align:start position:0%
users. now we're thinking of a third user but the two main users of you

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:44.230 align:start position:0%
user but the two main users of you probably have noticed already are the

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
probably have noticed already are the infrastructure operator and the

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
infrastructure operator and the investor or supporter. on one side the

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
investor or supporter. on one side the infrastructure operator as I was saying

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
infrastructure operator as I was saying takes care of uploading the information

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.350 align:start position:0%
takes care of uploading the information the device information how this is

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.910 align:start position:0%
the device information how this is technically behaving how is the type of

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
technically behaving how is the type of revenue it's going to generate is

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.710 align:start position:0%
revenue it's going to generate is it's going to generate distributions or

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
it's going to generate distributions or revenue distributions

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:20.069 align:start position:0%
revenue distributions every month every week or every

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:23.509 align:start position:0%
every month every week or every quarter or annually. And those are the

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
quarter or annually. And those are the those sets the expected APR

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
those sets the expected APR that the infrastructure operator is

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.829 align:start position:0%
that the infrastructure operator is offering. once this is done then

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:38.150 align:start position:0%
offering. once this is done then this goes into the blockchain. So it's

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
this goes into the blockchain. So it's it's committed that okay this is the

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
it's committed that okay this is the information we're committed for the

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.190 align:start position:0%
information we're committed for the posterior auditing and then as I said

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.829 align:start position:0%
posterior auditing and then as I said this is reviewed the authenticity and

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
this is reviewed the authenticity and the validity of the information

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.269 align:start position:0%
the validity of the information &gt;&gt; maybe maybe you can just have a moment

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.949 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; maybe maybe you can just have a moment there's there's a couple of questions

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:58.870 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple of questions &gt;&gt;

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes so yes actually well going for

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
yes so yes actually well going for the first question what are latam in

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.670 align:start position:0%
the first question what are latam in front of operator Latin operators are

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.150 align:start position:0%
front of operator Latin operators are Latin American infrastructure operators.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
Latin American infrastructure operators. They are the ones that that want to get

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.150 align:start position:0%
They are the ones that that want to get funded.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
funded. RWS and infra are inherently illquid.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.310 align:start position:0%
RWS and infra are inherently illquid. How do you address that? Yes. that's

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.829 align:start position:0%
How do you address that? Yes. that's one of the innovation that we are we are

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:31.269 align:start position:0%
one of the innovation that we are we are doing is that we are not tokenizing

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:33.829 align:start position:0%
doing is that we are not tokenizing maybe that was one point that I was

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
maybe that was one point that I was missing is that we are not tokenizing

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.069 align:start position:0%
missing is that we are not tokenizing the infrastructure by itself but what we

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:44.310 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure by itself but what we are focusing is on the revenue this

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
are focusing is on the revenue this infrastructure is going to to generate

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.870 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is going to to generate and that comes with a higher risk

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.750 align:start position:0%
and that comes with a higher risk obviously but then it balances is the

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
obviously but then it balances is the higher risk with the with a higher APR.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
higher risk with the with a higher APR. how do you solve regulatory

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.670 align:start position:0%
how do you solve regulatory compliance low issues? yes, this is

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.230 align:start position:0%
compliance low issues? yes, this is I I I I really don't think I will be

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.310 align:start position:0%
I I I I really don't think I will be able to address all of those

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
able to address all of those regulatory compliance issues, but I can

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
regulatory compliance issues, but I can say that because of the of the nature of

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
say that because of the of the nature of the project that as I was saying earlier

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.310 align:start position:0%
the project that as I was saying earlier we are not tokenizing an asset and it

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.030 align:start position:0%
we are not tokenizing an asset and it itself but we are working with the

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.629 align:start position:0%
itself but we are working with the future revenue it will produce that can

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
future revenue it will produce that can solve

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
solve other type of compliance around

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.269 align:start position:0%
other type of compliance around regulation issues but also it's

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:38.069 align:start position:0%
regulation issues but also it's important to mention that this is

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:41.910 align:start position:0%
important to mention that this is very local and depending on on on

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
very local and depending on on on each country finally so it will it

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.190 align:start position:0%
each country finally so it will it won't be the same for example the same

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
won't be the same for example the same in the US and here in Germany or in

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:53.190 align:start position:0%
in the US and here in Germany or in Chile

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.829 align:start position:0%
Chile okay then wait pay is this a loan or

00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:59.829 align:start position:0%
okay then wait pay is this a loan or is it a revenue participating in the

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.350 align:start position:0%
is it a revenue participating in the project

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.870 align:start position:0%
project Yes. So this can be considered as

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.150 align:start position:0%
Yes. So this can be considered as m multiple things. So in the end is

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.670 align:start position:0%
m multiple things. So in the end is the this revenue for the what the

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.710 align:start position:0%
the this revenue for the what the infrastructure generates that's as I was

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
infrastructure generates that's as I was saying is what's being kind of

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.710 align:start position:0%
saying is what's being kind of tokenized.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
tokenized. so but then if you look at from a

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
so but then if you look at from a different perspective then or the

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.150 align:start position:0%
different perspective then or the traditional perspective this could be

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
traditional perspective this could be taken as alone from the chat file. I

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.389 align:start position:0%
taken as alone from the chat file. I I see Oscar was as

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.230 align:start position:0%
I see Oscar was as now

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.389 align:start position:0%
now

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.470 align:start position:0%
is there I don't know is who review central yes I think that's those are

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
central yes I think that's those are most of the questions then yes this

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
most of the questions then yes this is obviously this is a a regulated

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.389 align:start position:0%
is obviously this is a a regulated service it cannot is not the the

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.829 align:start position:0%
service it cannot is not the the wild west But now I I will focus

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:08.069 align:start position:0%
wild west But now I I will focus mostly on the technological part of how

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:10.389 align:start position:0%
mostly on the technological part of how we are addressing these issues because

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
we are addressing these issues because for compliance I think we we can take a

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
for compliance I think we we can take a bit longer to answer all of those

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.870 align:start position:0%
bit longer to answer all of those questions.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.350 align:start position:0%
Okay. So I'll continue then. so with this we are offering multiple

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
with this we are offering multiple features

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.829 align:start position:0%
features in this platform that this we can

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:34.949 align:start position:0%
in this platform that this we can submit multiple type of evidence.

00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
submit multiple type of evidence. this is based on on the concept of

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.150 align:start position:0%
this is based on on the concept of trusts where we are producing evidence

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.430 align:start position:0%
trusts where we are producing evidence for all of the stages and all of the

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
for all of the stages and all of the interaction the infrastructure and the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.749 align:start position:0%
interaction the infrastructure and the operators are generating and producing.

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:54.550 align:start position:0%
operators are generating and producing. What does that mean? For example,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.590 align:start position:0%
What does that mean? For example, when the operator the first one I

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
when the operator the first one I I mentioned it already, the operator can

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.030 align:start position:0%
I mentioned it already, the operator can submit, okay, these are the technical

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.389 align:start position:0%
submit, okay, these are the technical specifications or this is an invoice.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:07.670 align:start position:0%
specifications or this is an invoice. but then we can get more complex

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.949 align:start position:0%
but then we can get more complex evidence when we start to aggregate

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:14.069 align:start position:0%
evidence when we start to aggregate different types of evidence because

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
different types of evidence because one in invoice alone for alone for

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.269 align:start position:0%
one in invoice alone for alone for example would mean okay you you will

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
example would mean okay you you will you will receive this payment in the

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.910 align:start position:0%
you will receive this payment in the future or you are receiving it now but

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.829 align:start position:0%
future or you are receiving it now but then to do the accounting evidence

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
then to do the accounting evidence for example for that we need to connect

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.949 align:start position:0%
for example for that we need to connect with the ERP of the of the business and

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:36.550 align:start position:0%
with the ERP of the of the business and that's more complex than just

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.110 align:start position:0%
that's more complex than just verifying a a single invoice. Then

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.470 align:start position:0%
verifying a a single invoice. Then humanoled guided integrity check

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.189 align:start position:0%
humanoled guided integrity check means that even though this

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:50.150 align:start position:0%
means that even though this project or what we are doing is

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
project or what we are doing is highly depending on automatization

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.949 align:start position:0%
highly depending on automatization automat automation

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
automat automation we still require people in the

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.310 align:start position:0%
we still require people in the loop. personally looked at so

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.549 align:start position:0%
loop. personally looked at so everything goes yes as as I was

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
everything goes yes as as I was mentioning earlier on the the accord

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.309 align:start position:0%
mentioning earlier on the the accord regulation then will rely on the

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
regulation then will rely on the onchain verification module so all of

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.909 align:start position:0%
onchain verification module so all of the transactions especially for the the

00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
the transactions especially for the the the stakeholders that are supporting the

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.429 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders that are supporting the project or the infrastructure operator

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
project or the infrastructure operator they can see how all of these actions

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
they can see how all of these actions are being verified and chained how

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.270 align:start position:0%
are being verified and chained how they are transparent with the respective

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.950 align:start position:0%
they are transparent with the respective proofs.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.950 align:start position:0%
proofs. And finally

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.549 align:start position:0%
And finally as every project is different

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:41.110 align:start position:0%
as every project is different all of them will have a different type

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.150 align:start position:0%
all of them will have a different type of scorings for for and with this will

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.870 align:start position:0%
of scorings for for and with this will represent basically from high risk

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
represent basically from high risk project to and higher APR and

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.909 align:start position:0%
project to and higher APR and lower risk and lower therefore APR

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.909 align:start position:0%
and in practical terms how is this the overview of this this smart

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.310 align:start position:0%
the overview of this this smart contracts in particular for the token

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.830 align:start position:0%
contracts in particular for the token studio is that we as the the or

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.150 align:start position:0%
studio is that we as the the or the infrastructure operator deploys the

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.549 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure operator deploys the the splitter contract

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:23.669 align:start position:0%
the splitter contract and there we have different functions

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
and there we have different functions to define the shareholders

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.789 align:start position:0%
to define the shareholders how are they going to be allocated,

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:33.270 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be allocated, how are they going to do the

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
how are they going to do the withdrawals every how how often

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:41.669 align:start position:0%
withdrawals every how how often are going to be the distribution events

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:47.190 align:start position:0%
are going to be the distribution events and to which token is this binded

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.430 align:start position:0%
and to which token is this binded regularly we will be working with

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.590 align:start position:0%
regularly we will be working with USDC

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.510 align:start position:0%
USDC but for example this could take other

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
but for example this could take other type of tokens if that's how that

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.710 align:start position:0%
type of tokens if that's how that project is defined but most of most

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.350 align:start position:0%
project is defined but most of most of the time we work with USDC

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
of the time we work with USDC and in in simple terms it's super

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.430 align:start position:0%
and in in simple terms it's super s I think it's super easy to

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
s I think it's super easy to understand if there's one chair

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%
understand if there's one chair holder or token holder with the 10%

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:23.909 align:start position:0%
holder or token holder with the 10% then once the distribution take place

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:26.789 align:start position:0%
then once the distribution take place all of the

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.630 align:start position:0%
all of the all of the revenue that was generated

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.750 align:start position:0%
all of the revenue that was generated and was deposited in into the smart

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.549 align:start position:0%
and was deposited in into the smart contract then it will go a 10% into

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:39.430 align:start position:0%
contract then it will go a 10% into the the one that has a 10% of of the

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
the the one that has a 10% of of the tokens.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.630 align:start position:0%
tokens. So on how this distribution flow goes

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.909 align:start position:0%
So on how this distribution flow goes is that first

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
is that first we have the admin that communicates

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.470 align:start position:0%
we have the admin that communicates to the distri to the splitter contract

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.590 align:start position:0%
to the distri to the splitter contract that's going to do the distribution

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.549 align:start position:0%
that's going to do the distribution what's the token address then this is

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
what's the token address then this is verified inside of the smart contract

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.150 align:start position:0%
verified inside of the smart contract then it verifies

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
then it verifies then check the current balance for

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.789 align:start position:0%
then check the current balance for example are those Are there 100

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
example are those Are there 100 tokens to to distribute and then in each

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.270 align:start position:0%
tokens to to distribute and then in each case it's the loop checking on the

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.669 align:start position:0%
case it's the loop checking on the token holders

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:24.230 align:start position:0%
token holders and the respective balance and and

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.950 align:start position:0%
and the respective balance and and there that's how it does the calculation

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
there that's how it does the calculation and this goes then into the storage

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
and this goes then into the storage class where where finish where it's

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.630 align:start position:0%
class where where finish where it's finished with the distribution. It's

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.549 align:start position:0%
finished with the distribution. It's really straightforward.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:47.350 align:start position:0%
really straightforward. Then for the withdraw then the each

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.909 align:start position:0%
Then for the withdraw then the each shareholder or token holder goes into

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
shareholder or token holder goes into the the splitter

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
the the splitter it does the prospective verification

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
it does the prospective verification check with the storage what's the

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
check with the storage what's the current allocation then decrease on the

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.470 align:start position:0%
current allocation then decrease on the storage part then

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.350 align:start position:0%
storage part then communicates directly with the token

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
communicates directly with the token the token does a transfer with a good

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.390 align:start position:0%
the token does a transfer with a good successful withdraw

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.190 align:start position:0%
successful withdraw And then it goes again to the to the

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
And then it goes again to the to the throold

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
throold and at the storage level this is just

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.190 align:start position:0%
and at the storage level this is just just in case I'm presenting it this

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.510 align:start position:0%
just in case I'm presenting it this like this because we are currently

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.630 align:start position:0%
like this because we are currently going under the respective revisions and

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.430 align:start position:0%
going under the respective revisions and auditings. so it's it cannot be

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
auditings. so it's it cannot be everything public. I mean this can

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
everything public. I mean this can but not the code itself yet.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.310 align:start position:0%
but not the code itself yet. And then we have the the cher data

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.710 align:start position:0%
And then we have the the cher data key, the config data key and the

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.549 align:start position:0%
key, the config data key and the allocation data key which basically

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
allocation data key which basically defines

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
defines how is the

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.390 align:start position:0%
how is the how is the charge for each data holder,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.029 align:start position:0%
how is the charge for each data holder, who's the admin, all of the security,

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
who's the admin, all of the security, what's the allocation for each token

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.350 align:start position:0%
what's the allocation for each token holder and and then how this can be

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.510 align:start position:0%
holder and and then how this can be allocated each time the distribution

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.510 align:start position:0%
allocated each time the distribution goes.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
Then here on the security level on how we are

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.549 align:start position:0%
on the security level on how we are defining we are taking this very

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
defining we are taking this very seriously defining the access

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.870 align:start position:0%
seriously defining the access control policies admin only function the

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
control policies admin only function the authentication the lock on contract the

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.710 align:start position:0%
authentication the lock on contract the transfer contracts

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.669 align:start position:0%
transfer contracts also we have our internal scripts

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
also we have our internal scripts for doing the a to have a deployer and

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.870 align:start position:0%
for doing the a to have a deployer and do an anatomical

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.230 align:start position:0%
do an anatomical operations. So we don't run on front run

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.029 align:start position:0%
operations. So we don't run on front run is front front running

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:49.510 align:start position:0%
is front front running then we have allocation limits some

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.510 align:start position:0%
then we have allocation limits some validations

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.710 align:start position:0%
validations and and so on.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.270 align:start position:0%
and and so on. and this as a first case we've

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.750 align:start position:0%
and this as a first case we've presented this to investment of returns

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.710 align:start position:0%
presented this to investment of returns for the for the the investors or

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.029 align:start position:0%
for the for the the investors or supporters of of the project of

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
supporters of of the project of infrastructure. But this for example

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.070 align:start position:0%
infrastructure. But this for example could be used as token vesting models

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.390 align:start position:0%
could be used as token vesting models over team members on time for similar

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.029 align:start position:0%
over team members on time for similar to the revenue trading for a DAO

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:26.950 align:start position:0%
to the revenue trading for a DAO treasury or for reward distribution.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.789 align:start position:0%
And then for the particular the feature that were missing for

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:36.390 align:start position:0%
the feature that were missing for before are that this is a secure and

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.149 align:start position:0%
before are that this is a secure and transparent way on how this

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
transparent way on how this distribution

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.909 align:start position:0%
distribution method is performed because all of

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:45.350 align:start position:0%
method is performed because all of the transactions are done on chain and

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.350 align:start position:0%
the transactions are done on chain and that these transactions are then

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
that these transactions are then proportional to each one of the

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.669 align:start position:0%
proportional to each one of the supporters.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
So yes, thank you very much. I I hope I didn't pass on time and

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.909 align:start position:0%
I didn't pass on time and &gt;&gt; we we have we have a few questions.

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; we we have we have a few questions. &gt;&gt; in in the chat I think.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; in in the chat I think. &gt;&gt; okay.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; okay. &gt;&gt; I think the

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.070 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think the answer

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.830 align:start position:0%
answer &gt;&gt; yes. So where I was I left is it

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.070 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; yes. So where I was I left is it either alone with interest or is it at

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.549 align:start position:0%
either alone with interest or is it at your particip Yes. As I said, it's more

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
your particip Yes. As I said, it's more of a chair participation of the project.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
of a chair participation of the project. I was making the the loan with interest

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.710 align:start position:0%
I was making the the loan with interest at the beginning to make the analogy

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
at the beginning to make the analogy with traditional banking settings.

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:39.269 align:start position:0%
with traditional banking settings. who will review centralized entities?

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:43.669 align:start position:0%
who will review centralized entities? yes. I mean this needs to go all

00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:46.789 align:start position:0%
yes. I mean this needs to go all of all of the businesses and infrastruct

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
of all of the businesses and infrastruct which are the infrastructure operators

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.510 align:start position:0%
which are the infrastructure operators in this case goes into a know your

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.590 align:start position:0%
in this case goes into a know your business process because this has to

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.070 align:start position:0%
business process because this has to also go with antimony laundering

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.430 align:start position:0%
also go with antimony laundering policy and and all of those regulations.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.909 align:start position:0%
policy and and all of those regulations. does that mean that the entire review

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the entire review process and due diligence is no the

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
process and due diligence is no the proofs or more than the proofs the

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
proofs or more than the proofs the the hash of the proofs and the evidence

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
the hash of the proofs and the evidence are stored unchanged because we cannot

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.990 align:start position:0%
are stored unchanged because we cannot just publish yeah accounting

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
just publish yeah accounting states or financial states from

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.710 align:start position:0%
states or financial states from companies on chain. is it really 100%

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.669 align:start position:0%
companies on chain. is it really 100% of the project's revenue or is it some

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:35.590 align:start position:0%
of the project's revenue or is it some Yes. so when when we consider this

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.710 align:start position:0%
Yes. so when when we consider this there's for the for example the the

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0%
there's for the for example the the energy production that a solar panel is

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:43.190 align:start position:0%
energy production that a solar panel is going to to generate

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.149 align:start position:0%
going to to generate it's going let's say it generates 100

00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:50.070 align:start position:0%
it's going let's say it generates 100 dollars per week. Then from

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.669 align:start position:0%
dollars per week. Then from this there's a minimal amount

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
this there's a minimal amount that's defined during the creation of

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
that's defined during the creation of the project that needs to go by to

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.470 align:start position:0%
the project that needs to go by to the operation itself. that could be

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.230 align:start position:0%
the operation itself. that could be for example 30% or 20% that

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.789 align:start position:0%
for example 30% or 20% that depends on the on the project.

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:15.029 align:start position:0%
depends on the on the project. so it's finally on the

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.430 align:start position:0%
so it's finally on the discounted from the operation then

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.950 align:start position:0%
discounted from the operation then that's what goes into the what's the

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.390 align:start position:0%
that's what goes into the what's the distributed how could you manage then

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
distributed how could you manage then state expiration if you are storing

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.630 align:start position:0%
state expiration if you are storing hashes on chain

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
hashes on chain

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.350 align:start position:0%
do you mean like if a proof is expired for example I I'm not

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
expired for example I I'm not to which state do you mean?

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:54.149 align:start position:0%
to which state do you mean? world matias.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yes. so that is so when proofs are verified

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.390 align:start position:0%
that is so when proofs are verified it it depends on the type of pro proof

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
it it depends on the type of pro proof and there are multiple risk risk when

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:11.269 align:start position:0%
and there are multiple risk risk when you verify proofs. certainly one is

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.909 align:start position:0%
you verify proofs. certainly one is for example using old proofs or

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:19.190 align:start position:0%
for example using old proofs or reusing proofs. Other is

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.070 align:start position:0%
reusing proofs. Other is just trying to use past evidence as

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.029 align:start position:0%
just trying to use past evidence as newly evidence. But all of those

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
newly evidence. But all of those parts are very part of the ver that

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.909 align:start position:0%
parts are very part of the ver that of the offchain verification. And when

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
of the offchain verification. And when the onchain verification happens

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.590 align:start position:0%
the onchain verification happens this proof is has been already

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.549 align:start position:0%
this proof is has been already through this process.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.630 align:start position:0%
yes. So currently the the guarantees where

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.789 align:start position:0%
do I pass this? Ah yeah let me answer this first. yes. So there's currently

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:09.990 align:start position:0%
this first. yes. So there's currently a new feature we want to to to do is

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.590 align:start position:0%
a new feature we want to to to do is to actually put some collateral that can

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
to actually put some collateral that can give stakeholders more guarantees.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.990 align:start position:0%
give stakeholders more guarantees. So ina so we would because from the

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
So ina so we would because from the beginning this sounds more like okay we

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
beginning this sounds more like okay we will we could be giving random money to

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
will we could be giving random money to a strangers stranger that maybe at that

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.789 align:start position:0%
a strangers stranger that maybe at that point everything was true but then still

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
point everything was true but then still did a rock pole as as you mentioned and

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.710 align:start position:0%
did a rock pole as as you mentioned and and therefore we are creating this

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
and therefore we are creating this other collateralization mechanisms

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.029 align:start position:0%
other collateralization mechanisms but that's not defined yet. But

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
but that's not defined yet. But that's why also on the first stage of

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.470 align:start position:0%
that's why also on the first stage of this we are focusing only on companies

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.750 align:start position:0%
this we are focusing only on companies that we know

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.909 align:start position:0%
that we know that can give this guarantees and are

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
that can give this guarantees and are not a meme company for example. So

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.830 align:start position:0%
not a meme company for example. So that's one one really important

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.070 align:start position:0%
that's one one really important point.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
point.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.950 align:start position:0%
so stellar asset or so. So so the tok the the

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
the tok the the stellar

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
stellar the artist this token actual stellar

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.909 align:start position:0%
the artist this token actual stellar asset or sorban tokens. So as we as I

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:28.470 align:start position:0%
asset or sorban tokens. So as we as I was saying it's the token that's

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.190 align:start position:0%
was saying it's the token that's distributed is a USDC

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.269 align:start position:0%
distributed is a USDC and how the asset of the token holder

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:40.549 align:start position:0%
and how the asset of the token holder is also a token because why and

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
is also a token because why and why not a regular seller asset because

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
why not a regular seller asset because we needed to create some extra functions

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
we needed to create some extra functions that were not into the assets.

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.470 align:start position:0%
Okay, great. I think I think you got caught up on all the questions. It's

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.830 align:start position:0%
caught up on all the questions. It's great to see that there's so many

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.590 align:start position:0%
great to see that there's so many questions, so much interest in in what

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.230 align:start position:0%
questions, so much interest in in what you guys are doing and how you how you

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.950 align:start position:0%
you guys are doing and how you how you how you structure it. So yeah, it was

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.230 align:start position:0%
how you structure it. So yeah, it was great. if there's no other questions,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.269 align:start position:0%
great. if there's no other questions, then I guess we can we can stop here,

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
then I guess we can we can stop here, but thank you so much for for joining

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.470 align:start position:0%
but thank you so much for for joining today. I think it's super interesting to

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.510 align:start position:0%
today. I think it's super interesting to see what you're doing. It's I I kind

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.029 align:start position:0%
see what you're doing. It's I I kind of I kind of like these type of

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:26.230 align:start position:0%
of I kind of like these type of projects that are not not the typical

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.190 align:start position:0%
projects that are not not the typical projects we see. it's definitely

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.750 align:start position:0%
projects we see. it's definitely using using tokens and using the

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
using using tokens and using the platform in a different way. I think

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.070 align:start position:0%
platform in a different way. I think that's that's super interesting.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:36.710 align:start position:0%
that's that's super interesting. yeah.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just let me add there's a last

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Just let me add there's a last one.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.789 align:start position:0%
one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. To to answer that last

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:46.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. To to answer that last question. Yes. One of our also our

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.389 align:start position:0%
question. Yes. One of our also our current goals is to bring

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:53.830 align:start position:0%
current goals is to bring liquidity from other blockchains

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.789 align:start position:0%
liquidity from other blockchains in particular from Ethereum based

00:30:56.799 --> 00:31:00.630 align:start position:0%
in particular from Ethereum based blockchains liquidity and that's

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.590 align:start position:0%
blockchains liquidity and that's because actually we're not only based on

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
because actually we're not only based on working on stellar but we're also

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:07.350 align:start position:0%
working on stellar but we're also working on base

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.870 align:start position:0%
working on base and we see this potential from

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.990 align:start position:0%
and we see this potential from bringing more liquidity to stellar

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
bringing more liquidity to stellar from base through this infrastructure

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.549 align:start position:0%
from base through this infrastructure projects and yes we are taking a

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
projects and yes we are taking a look at near intense.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.710 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Great. Well, thank you for joining everyone and thank you for joining too,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
everyone and thank you for joining too, Fernando. It was great to to catch up

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:38.389 align:start position:0%
Fernando. It was great to to catch up with you and I'm sure I'll see you at

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
with you and I'm sure I'll see you at events around the world like I have this

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
events around the world like I have this the past year. Thank you for the

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.070 align:start position:0%
the past year. Thank you for the invitation. It was a pleasure.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
invitation. It was a pleasure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and if anyone else has any

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:50.549 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and if anyone else has any questions, I'm sure you can reach out to

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:53.269 align:start position:0%
questions, I'm sure you can reach out to the team on on Discord. I think one of

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:54.549 align:start position:0%
the team on on Discord. I think one of the things that's very interesting about

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:57.430 align:start position:0%
the things that's very interesting about this is that brings up some use cases

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.909 align:start position:0%
this is that brings up some use cases and some some things that are that

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:04.070 align:start position:0%
and some some things that are that that raises some questions because maybe

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.669 align:start position:0%
that raises some questions because maybe we haven't seen that before or maybe

00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that before or maybe we're not used to thinking about

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.110 align:start position:0%
we're not used to thinking about tokenization in this way or using the

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.870 align:start position:0%
tokenization in this way or using the platform. So, a lot of great questions

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
platform. So, a lot of great questions that really that really I think you

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.350 align:start position:0%
that really that really I think you had great answers and it's it's

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.190 align:start position:0%
had great answers and it's it's interesting to to see how you're

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.029 align:start position:0%
interesting to to see how you're building this. So, thank you everyone

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:23.750 align:start position:0%
building this. So, thank you everyone and see you again next week.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
and see you again next week. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Bye. Bye.
