00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.550 align:start position:0%
um so these protocol discussions are where we have uh go over caps which are

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.249 align:start position:0%
where we have uh go over caps which are core advancement proposals these are

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
core advancement proposals these are basically specifications for how to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.169 align:start position:0%
basically specifications for how to update Stellar core and the Stellar

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.270 align:start position:0%
update Stellar core and the Stellar protocol in order to implement new

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.910 align:start position:0%
protocol in order to implement new features and make major changes

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 align:start position:0%
features and make major changes um any cap actually goes through a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.990 align:start position:0%
um any cap actually goes through a process where it's drafted it's

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.849 align:start position:0%
process where it's drafted it's discussed in open on the Stellar Dev

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.490 align:start position:0%
discussed in open on the Stellar Dev mailing list which you can join and then

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.750 align:start position:0%
mailing list which you can join and then eventually it's brought to this meeting

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.009 align:start position:0%
eventually it's brought to this meeting when it's time for a synchronous

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.769 align:start position:0%
when it's time for a synchronous discussion all caps go through a review

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.709 align:start position:0%
discussion all caps go through a review process get vetted and eventually before

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.490 align:start position:0%
process get vetted and eventually before they're approved there there's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.490 align:start position:0%
they're approved there there's a pretty lengthy engagement with the the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 align:start position:0%
a pretty lengthy engagement with the the greater Stellar ecosystem

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.810 align:start position:0%
greater Stellar ecosystem uh finally when they are approved they

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 align:start position:0%
uh finally when they are approved they actually get bundled up into a new major

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 align:start position:0%
actually get bundled up into a new major protocol release and before that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.790 align:start position:0%
protocol release and before that protocol release actually hits the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.869 align:start position:0%
protocol release actually hits the network goes live on the network

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
network goes live on the network validators have to agree to accept that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
validators have to agree to accept that change so there is also a validator

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.729 align:start position:0%
change so there is also a validator governance

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.229 align:start position:0%
governance um step that's required before the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
um step that's required before the actual turning on of a new feature on

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.410 align:start position:0%
actual turning on of a new feature on Stellar

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.830 align:start position:0%
Stellar um So lately we have not had that many

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.850 align:start position:0%
um So lately we have not had that many protocol meetings and that's because

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 align:start position:0%
protocol meetings and that's because we've been I'm just gonna see if I can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.670 align:start position:0%
we've been I'm just gonna see if I can invite some people up to speak um

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.609 align:start position:0%
invite some people up to speak um uh and that is because uh the the Caps

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.690 align:start position:0%
uh and that is because uh the the Caps that we've been working on relate to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.910 align:start position:0%
that we've been working on relate to sorobon which is the uh smart contracts

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 align:start position:0%
sorobon which is the uh smart contracts platform that we're building that will

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.590 align:start position:0%
platform that we're building that will bring smart contracts to stellar and a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 align:start position:0%
bring smart contracts to stellar and a lot of work has been done on the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 align:start position:0%
lot of work has been done on the implementation side right so earlier

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510 align:start position:0%
implementation side right so earlier this year we were talking through about

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
this year we were talking through about eight caps and for now we've sort of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.890 align:start position:0%
eight caps and for now we've sort of worked on implementation of those we

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.450 align:start position:0%
worked on implementation of those we have launched them on the futurenet so

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010 align:start position:0%
have launched them on the futurenet so if you're listening to this and you want

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.530 align:start position:0%
if you're listening to this and you want to experiment with saurabhan you can on

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 align:start position:0%
to experiment with saurabhan you can on a Dev Network a Dev test Network that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.890 align:start position:0%
a Dev Network a Dev test Network that exists right now

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.450 align:start position:0%
exists right now um but today we do have a discussion

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.810 align:start position:0%
um but today we do have a discussion that we want to have around a cap which

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.130 align:start position:0%
that we want to have around a cap which hit the mailing list there were some

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.210 align:start position:0%
hit the mailing list there were some changes that hit the mailing list

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.249 align:start position:0%
changes that hit the mailing list earlier uh actually I think yesterday

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.969 align:start position:0%
earlier uh actually I think yesterday and so that cap is capped 46-06 smart

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.850 align:start position:0%
and so that cap is capped 46-06 smart contract standardized asset there's a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 align:start position:0%
contract standardized asset there's a link to the actual cap in the show notes

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.109 align:start position:0%
link to the actual cap in the show notes or in the event description so if you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
or in the event description so if you want to follow this discussion which

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 align:start position:0%
want to follow this discussion which will be technical I definitely advise

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.870 align:start position:0%
will be technical I definitely advise reading the cap we're going to get into

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.630 align:start position:0%
reading the cap we're going to get into the details today

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.449 align:start position:0%
the details today and so I is there anyone else who needs

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.949 align:start position:0%
and so I is there anyone else who needs to be brought up to the stage I guess we

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
to be brought up to the stage I guess we can go ahead and start and we can bring

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.490 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and start and we can bring people on stage as necessary I think to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.830 align:start position:0%
people on stage as necessary I think to start with cap 4606

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 align:start position:0%
start with cap 4606 um so Darth do you want to just start

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.770 align:start position:0%
um so Darth do you want to just start out by talking a little bit about the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.290 align:start position:0%
out by talking a little bit about the cap by walking through the changes and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.910 align:start position:0%
cap by walking through the changes and uh just sort of set up the discussion

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh just sort of set up the discussion for the rest of the meeting

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.170 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the meeting yeah I can do that so uh this cap is

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.589 align:start position:0%
yeah I can do that so uh this cap is about a standardized token contract uh

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.990 align:start position:0%
about a standardized token contract uh on sorbon or what we call now the uh the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.210 align:start position:0%
on sorbon or what we call now the uh the built-in token contract

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
built-in token contract um and you know we already have an

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.690 align:start position:0%
um and you know we already have an initial implementation of this that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 align:start position:0%
initial implementation of this that people are using on feature net and this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 align:start position:0%
people are using on feature net and this cap has been out for a while but I'll go

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.229 align:start position:0%
cap has been out for a while but I'll go over the recent changes at a high level

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.809 align:start position:0%
over the recent changes at a high level uh so the most significant one is that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.369 align:start position:0%
uh so the most significant one is that the token balances have been updated

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start position:0%
the token balances have been updated from

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.650 align:start position:0%
from uh bigint to uh u128 uh and again these

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.970 align:start position:0%
uh bigint to uh u128 uh and again these are just updates of the cap not the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.009 align:start position:0%
are just updates of the cap not the actual implementation yet

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.630 align:start position:0%
actual implementation yet um approve the approved function was

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670 align:start position:0%
um approve the approved function was replaced with increased allowance and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.710 align:start position:0%
replaced with increased allowance and decreased allowance methods uh there are

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.690 align:start position:0%
decreased allowance methods uh there are some naming changes to make sore Bond

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.130 align:start position:0%
some naming changes to make sore Bond terminology match up with Stellar

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
terminology match up with Stellar classic like burn was uh change the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
classic like burn was uh change the cloud back for use of the authorize

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.850 align:start position:0%
cloud back for use of the authorize unfreeze to authorize

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.170 align:start position:0%
unfreeze to authorize um we allow the admin to disable

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.809 align:start position:0%
um we allow the admin to disable clawback along with rules on how it's

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.690 align:start position:0%
clawback along with rules on how it's set for wrapped assets

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.750 align:start position:0%
set for wrapped assets and then there's this wasn't explicitly

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.130 align:start position:0%
and then there's this wasn't explicitly out of the cap it was in the mailing

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.470 align:start position:0%
out of the cap it was in the mailing list uh discussions around how auth

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.449 align:start position:0%
list uh discussions around how auth required should be handled and I had two

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.850 align:start position:0%
required should be handled and I had two ideas there that we can discuss

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.229 align:start position:0%
ideas there that we can discuss um and it sounds like author bride is

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
um and it sounds like author bride is something that we will need to handle

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.350 align:start position:0%
something that we will need to handle um yeah so does anyone have any

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
um yeah so does anyone have any questions

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.670 align:start position:0%
Russians comments yeah

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.390 align:start position:0%
yeah it started something simple uh the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
it started something simple uh the naming conventions I understand they

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.770 align:start position:0%
naming conventions I understand they align with uh with Stellar classic do

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.289 align:start position:0%
align with uh with Stellar classic do they also align with

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.089 align:start position:0%
they also align with um the you know the greater kind of like

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.970 align:start position:0%
um the you know the greater kind of like cryptocurrency ecosystem and equivalent

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.429 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency ecosystem and equivalent contracts on say

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
contracts on say um ethereum

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.649 align:start position:0%
um ethereum so the burn to clavac the uh that that

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
so the burn to clavac the uh that that actually matches up with uh erc20 for

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.629 align:start position:0%
actually matches up with uh erc20 for example just burn on the open Zeppelin

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.949 align:start position:0%
example just burn on the open Zeppelin erc20

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.590 align:start position:0%
erc20 standard actually refers to a user

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.749 align:start position:0%
standard actually refers to a user burning their own balance which is not

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.550 align:start position:0%
burning their own balance which is not what burn does it does in the total

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.590 align:start position:0%
what burn does it does in the total contract today in the sermon tone

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.350 align:start position:0%
contract today in the sermon tone contract that matches clawback

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.110 align:start position:0%
contract that matches clawback uh for freeze unfreeze

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.610 align:start position:0%
uh for freeze unfreeze um

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.530 align:start position:0%
um uh it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.050 align:start position:0%
uh it this is a question we had it was like I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.550 align:start position:0%
this is a question we had it was like I I switched it to authorized the author

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.409 align:start position:0%
I switched it to authorized the author just because we want to be we want

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.749 align:start position:0%
just because we want to be we want clawback to be able to be used on Frozen

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.909 align:start position:0%
clawback to be able to be used on Frozen balances and we didn't want someone to

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.610 align:start position:0%
balances and we didn't want someone to make the assumption that a you know a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.350 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that a you know a frozen balance can change because it can

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.689 align:start position:0%
frozen balance can change because it can through callback

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.469 align:start position:0%
through callback um

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.249 align:start position:0%
um I believe uh on on the ethereum side

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.170 align:start position:0%
I believe uh on on the ethereum side it's actually called I think it's blue

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.770 align:start position:0%
it's actually called I think it's blue it's not possible and you unpause it uh

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.689 align:start position:0%
it's not possible and you unpause it uh so it's a little different from that uh

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.370 align:start position:0%
so it's a little different from that uh do you have concerns over those

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.010 align:start position:0%
do you have concerns over those differences

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.969 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think the the the blacklistable contracts that for

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.490 align:start position:0%
the the blacklistable contracts that for example uscc adheres to actually use as

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
example uscc adheres to actually use as a completely different language which is

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.810 align:start position:0%
a completely different language which is uh blacklisting

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.129 align:start position:0%
uh blacklisting um which yeah its own uh issues

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.409 align:start position:0%
um which yeah its own uh issues yeah that's unique to usdc right that's

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.170 align:start position:0%
yeah that's unique to usdc right that's not even you know

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
not even you know like like a common erc20 implementation

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.170 align:start position:0%
like like a common erc20 implementation uh that's a good question I haven't

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.469 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question I haven't looked at others

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.850 align:start position:0%
looked at others I'll uh I'll take a look at that

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:55.730 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I definitely think that it makes sense to just like choose

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
makes sense to just like choose something and then go with it uh but

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.529 align:start position:0%
something and then go with it uh but maybe just like survey the ecosystem and

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.330 align:start position:0%
maybe just like survey the ecosystem and and make sure that there are no

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.430 align:start position:0%
and make sure that there are no standards that were

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.330 align:start position:0%
standards that were um

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.029 align:start position:0%
um overlooking it doesn't look like we have

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:15.290 align:start position:0%
overlooking it doesn't look like we have okay

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.550 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned some um the the issue with auth required and

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.309 align:start position:0%
um the the issue with auth required and potential Solutions can you uh talk a

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.749 align:start position:0%
potential Solutions can you uh talk a bit about

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.990 align:start position:0%
bit about um a what the issue is uh to reiterate

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
um a what the issue is uh to reiterate that and uh what are some potential

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
that and uh what are some potential Solutions

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.210 align:start position:0%
Solutions yeah so currently uh on solar classic if

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.790 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently uh on solar classic if the issuer has uh has the auth required

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.430 align:start position:0%
the issuer has uh has the auth required flag set any new trust line will be

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.350 align:start position:0%
flag set any new trust line will be deauthorized by default

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.930 align:start position:0%
deauthorized by default uh and the reason for this is that you

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.809 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason for this is that you know the issuer may want to verify the

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.029 align:start position:0%
know the issuer may want to verify the the owner of the trust line to make sure

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.650 align:start position:0%
the owner of the trust line to make sure that you know they can go they go

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.570 align:start position:0%
that you know they can go they go through kyc and you know you go through

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.070 align:start position:0%
through kyc and you know you go through you pass whatever regulations that they

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.050 align:start position:0%
you pass whatever regulations that they need to and then you enable the the

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.670 align:start position:0%
need to and then you enable the the trust line and they can do what they

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.790 align:start position:0%
trust line and they can do what they want uh that concept does not exist at

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.110 align:start position:0%
want uh that concept does not exist at the moment in the built-in token

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.689 align:start position:0%
the moment in the built-in token contract so if you've sent to a New

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.570 align:start position:0%
contract so if you've sent to a New Balance uh if you send an asset that is

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.249 align:start position:0%
Balance uh if you send an asset that is author card on the classic side that's

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
author card on the classic side that's wrapped and so our body you send it to a

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.270 align:start position:0%
wrapped and so our body you send it to a new balance that this new entity can

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.450 align:start position:0%
new balance that this new entity can receive it and this breaks the you know

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.990 align:start position:0%
receive it and this breaks the you know the author required semantics so the one

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.129 align:start position:0%
the author required semantics so the one idea I had was that in uh in the Tome

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.029 align:start position:0%
idea I had was that in uh in the Tome contract

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.189 align:start position:0%
contract there are no balances by default in the

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:28.850 align:start position:0%
there are no balances by default in the beginning

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
beginning and they only exist once they are you

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.249 align:start position:0%
and they only exist once they are you know once it's actually written uh into

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:36.350 align:start position:0%
know once it's actually written uh into a ledger entry

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.689 align:start position:0%
a ledger entry and uh so you can kind of you can treat

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.610 align:start position:0%
and uh so you can kind of you can treat that right as

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
that right as the initialization of the balance

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
the initialization of the balance my idea was to tie like when you do that

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
my idea was to tie like when you do that new like the when you create this New

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
new like the when you create this New Balance you check the issuer

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
Balance you check the issuer and if it does exist then you block it

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.070 align:start position:0%
and if it does exist then you block it and you require the issue explicitly

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.230 align:start position:0%
and you require the issue explicitly proves that trust all right it's not

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.150 align:start position:0%
proves that trust all right it's not that trust line approves that balance or

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.510 align:start position:0%
that trust line approves that balance or that identifier before it's created

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
that identifier before it's created um there are some issues around this

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.689 align:start position:0%
um there are some issues around this related to

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
related to um how you would actually indicate that

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.610 align:start position:0%
um how you would actually indicate that it's authorized but this is like that's

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.650 align:start position:0%
it's authorized but this is like that's that's the best idea I have so far the

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.350 align:start position:0%
that's the best idea I have so far the other one is to just not allow it's just

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.629 align:start position:0%
other one is to just not allow it's just disable add-on controls or not admin

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:20.330 align:start position:0%
disable add-on controls or not admin controls on sarban contract

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
controls on sarban contract uh for wrapped assets that that have uh

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.510 align:start position:0%
uh for wrapped assets that that have uh auth required set but this makes it much

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.909 align:start position:0%
auth required set but this makes it much more difficult for uh author guard

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:31.309 align:start position:0%
more difficult for uh author guard assets to be used on seller I'm sorry

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:39.409 align:start position:0%
assets to be used on seller I'm sorry but I'm sorry

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
there's also an uh maybe an ax-like approach in which we just don't enable

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
approach in which we just don't enable sorobond

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.170 align:start position:0%
sorobond uh like importing exporting at all to

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.850 align:start position:0%
uh like importing exporting at all to off acquired assets

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.850 align:start position:0%
off acquired assets that's true but I

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
that's true but I Jake has mentioned that uh there are

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.750 align:start position:0%
Jake has mentioned that uh there are some partners that are off the choir

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
some partners that are off the choir that want to participate in sorbon so

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.329 align:start position:0%
that want to participate in sorbon so that wouldn't be possible in that case

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:05.329 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be possible in that case uh it depend you know it depends on what

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:10.730 align:start position:0%
uh it depend you know it depends on what we what we want to do with those assets

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.250 align:start position:0%
are there drawbacks to the first approach that you outlined

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.769 align:start position:0%
uh it it adds it just adds some complexity uh

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:24.050 align:start position:0%
it adds it just adds some complexity uh like for example how do you store this I

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.370 align:start position:0%
like for example how do you store this I made this change in the cap but it

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.470 align:start position:0%
made this change in the cap but it actually isn't ideal where before we had

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.230 align:start position:0%
actually isn't ideal where before we had this a flag for when things are frozen

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
this a flag for when things are frozen which is not the normal case uh so

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.449 align:start position:0%
which is not the normal case uh so if you never freeze the balance in the

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:36.769 align:start position:0%
if you never freeze the balance in the current tone contract you never write

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:38.990 align:start position:0%
current tone contract you never write this extra Ledger entry but that writes

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.329 align:start position:0%
this extra Ledger entry but that writes a specific flag but I changed the cap to

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:42.949 align:start position:0%
a specific flag but I changed the cap to write the authorized flag so every

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.449 align:start position:0%
write the authorized flag so every balance will have a new entry that says

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:48.530 align:start position:0%
balance will have a new entry that says authorized so which is not necessary uh

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.570 align:start position:0%
authorized so which is not necessary uh by default for

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.850 align:start position:0%
by default for non-auth required assets I have an idea

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
non-auth required assets I have an idea to fix this you know you can tie the

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.650 align:start position:0%
to fix this you know you can tie the balance and this flag in a single Ledger

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.509 align:start position:0%
balance and this flag in a single Ledger entry

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:01.610 align:start position:0%
entry um but it just it just adds some

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
um but it just it just adds some complexity but I I but I think we do

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.570 align:start position:0%
complexity but I I but I think we do need to either not allow author required

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.790 align:start position:0%
need to either not allow author required Assets in sorbon or

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.090 align:start position:0%
Assets in sorbon or you know uh allow them using using a

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.130 align:start position:0%
you know uh allow them using using a mechanism like this

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
mechanism like this um so I I feel like if you want to allow

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.730 align:start position:0%
um so I I feel like if you want to allow author required that's a story about

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
author required that's a story about like this is probably the best or

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.170 align:start position:0%
like this is probably the best or something similar is the best thing we

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.870 align:start position:0%
something similar is the best thing we can do it I said just to be on the same

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.470 align:start position:0%
can do it I said just to be on the same page this means we effectively increase

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.769 align:start position:0%
page this means we effectively increase the complexity of the these rap token

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:32.810 align:start position:0%
the complexity of the these rap token contracts but the standard token

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.870 align:start position:0%
contracts but the standard token contract that you can still

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
contract that you can still um you know like issue uh that's pure

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.070 align:start position:0%
um you know like issue uh that's pure sorobond does it also inherit these

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.470 align:start position:0%
sorobond does it also inherit these complexities

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.910 align:start position:0%
complexities um I think we can we can do it in a way

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.310 align:start position:0%
um I think we can we can do it in a way where it doesn't right like it if

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.630 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't right like it if because you can if you can tell that

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.430 align:start position:0%
because you can if you can tell that it's a wrap token contract and in that

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.870 align:start position:0%
it's a wrap token contract and in that case then you can

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
case then you can uh check the issuer and check them out

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.130 align:start position:0%
uh check the issuer and check them out the required but if if it's not a

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.350 align:start position:0%
the required but if if it's not a wrapped token then you can ignore all of

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.790 align:start position:0%
wrapped token then you can ignore all of this right

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.829 align:start position:0%
this right and from a contract developer's

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:06.650 align:start position:0%
and from a contract developer's perspective that wants to interact uh

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.389 align:start position:0%
perspective that wants to interact uh from their perspective it's just the

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.889 align:start position:0%
from their perspective it's just the standard like are we changing the

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:12.230 align:start position:0%
standard like are we changing the standard token interface

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.150 align:start position:0%
standard token interface um or from their perspective it's just

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.210 align:start position:0%
um or from their perspective it's just another erc20 like standard token

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
another erc20 like standard token um implementer

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.350 align:start position:0%
uh the interface shouldn't have to change maybe the semantics around

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
change maybe the semantics around authorization the authorization would I

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.150 align:start position:0%
authorization the authorization would I think we can do it in a way where it

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
think we can do it in a way where it wouldn't it would be transparent to uh

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it would be transparent to uh soroban tokens

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.150 align:start position:0%
that make sense

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.090 align:start position:0%
yes

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.110 align:start position:0%
one thing I'll just say quickly is that um

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.290 align:start position:0%
um you know in today's uh today on the

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.449 align:start position:0%
you know in today's uh today on the network the assets that use author

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.310 align:start position:0%
network the assets that use author required they

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
required they um there are a lot of account holders

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.050 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of account holders but we are seeing organizations that are

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.090 align:start position:0%
but we are seeing organizations that are looking to have health required assets

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.389 align:start position:0%
looking to have health required assets be used on soar bomb balls so used by a

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:09.230 align:start position:0%
be used on soar bomb balls so used by a fairly large audience so I would

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.230 align:start position:0%
fairly large audience so I would I don't know if you know going forward

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.790 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you know going forward with an approach where

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.530 align:start position:0%
with an approach where arth required assets just simply aren't

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.350 align:start position:0%
arth required assets just simply aren't usable on sorbon is is I mean we could

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.370 align:start position:0%
usable on sorbon is is I mean we could do it

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.410 align:start position:0%
do it um but it's going to cut off some some

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.769 align:start position:0%
um but it's going to cut off some some use cases or for organizations that

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:27.110 align:start position:0%
use cases or for organizations that um you know from a Regulatory Compliance

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.569 align:start position:0%
um you know from a Regulatory Compliance perspective like need to have uh that

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:32.630 align:start position:0%
perspective like need to have uh that this requirement kyc like holders before

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.990 align:start position:0%
this requirement kyc like holders before holding their asset

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.490 align:start position:0%
so Jake just to be on the same page like you're saying that there is a group of

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.790 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there is a group of issuers that is growing and is

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.250 align:start position:0%
issuers that is growing and is um author required or planning to issue

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.170 align:start position:0%
um author required or planning to issue author card assets

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.850 align:start position:0%
author card assets um and out of this group there is a

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.230 align:start position:0%
um and out of this group there is a non-trivial

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.629 align:start position:0%
non-trivial uh

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh subgroup that is interested in having

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.850 align:start position:0%
subgroup that is interested in having their assets

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.449 align:start position:0%
their assets um

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:05.629 align:start position:0%
um available and and uh for like Defiance

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:08.629 align:start position:0%
available and and uh for like Defiance Orban exactly yeah we have a partner

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.310 align:start position:0%
Orban exactly yeah we have a partner today that's looking to

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
today that's looking to um you know participate in uh like amms

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.930 align:start position:0%
um you know participate in uh like amms and

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
and um and other like deep iconstructs on

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.829 align:start position:0%
um and other like deep iconstructs on sorbon but the asset they would like to

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.030 align:start position:0%
sorbon but the asset they would like to to use

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.650 align:start position:0%
to use um they are planning on using author

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.550 align:start position:0%
um they are planning on using author required

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:29.629 align:start position:0%
okay one one aspect of this which I think is a good thing but it's good to

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.790 align:start position:0%
think is a good thing but it's good to know is if you go to the first approach

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.030 align:start position:0%
know is if you go to the first approach I mentioned the issuer will need to

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the issuer will need to approve any address and any any

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.129 align:start position:0%
approve any address and any any identifier on soroban that wants to

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.690 align:start position:0%
identifier on soroban that wants to accept the balance so even if it's like

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.009 align:start position:0%
accept the balance so even if it's like a liquidity pool the issuer must uh you

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:47.750 align:start position:0%
a liquidity pool the issuer must uh you know approve that that liquidity pool's

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
know approve that that liquidity pool's address in the token contract

00:13:53.399 --> 00:14:05.629 align:start position:0%
yeah understood I think that's actually exactly what they're looking for yeah

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.350 align:start position:0%
there are a couple questions in the live chat too I don't know if you want to

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.910 align:start position:0%
chat too I don't know if you want to take a look at them sit or you want me

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.710 align:start position:0%
take a look at them sit or you want me to just read them out

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:21.170 align:start position:0%
to just read them out let's see

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:30.530 align:start position:0%
so where's uh the uh yeah I well one is oh yeah yeah

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
and then if you look below that there's some there's three there's a yeah two

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.550 align:start position:0%
some there's three there's a yeah two questions so for Quebec

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.370 align:start position:0%
questions so for Quebec sorry tomorrow do you wanna go

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.509 align:start position:0%
sorry tomorrow do you wanna go yep

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
yep okay uh clawback is uh

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
okay uh clawback is uh I think it's it's something we wanted to

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.269 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's something we wanted to support because it's supported on the uh

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
support because it's supported on the uh the classic side and right if you have a

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.310 align:start position:0%
the classic side and right if you have a an asset that is clawbackable

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
an asset that is clawbackable uh on classic and you move it over to

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.030 align:start position:0%
uh on classic and you move it over to sorbon then you know it's a control you

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.230 align:start position:0%
sorbon then you know it's a control you want to give the issue and it can be it

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.269 align:start position:0%
want to give the issue and it can be it can be disabled

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.610 align:start position:0%
can be disabled um I I do agree that quadak versus Burns

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.990 align:start position:0%
um I I do agree that quadak versus Burns is a little confusing we don't actually

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.930 align:start position:0%
is a little confusing we don't actually like the cap doesn't specify a burn in

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
like the cap doesn't specify a burn in the ERC 20 cents

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.670 align:start position:0%
the ERC 20 cents um and maybe it should uh right now

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.530 align:start position:0%
um and maybe it should uh right now I think that like what you could do is

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.889 align:start position:0%
I think that like what you could do is send to a zero u25519 address but maybe

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:23.930 align:start position:0%
send to a zero u25519 address but maybe that's not sufficient

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.090 align:start position:0%
that's not sufficient um but I agree maybe we can uh I can

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.009 align:start position:0%
um but I agree maybe we can uh I can think about like naming differences

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:29.870 align:start position:0%
think about like naming differences there a little more

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.790 align:start position:0%
there a little more um so for the

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.910 align:start position:0%
um so for the so vermouth's question for the decimals

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.470 align:start position:0%
so vermouth's question for the decimals uh

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.090 align:start position:0%
uh I agree so yeah the cap is actually

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.949 align:start position:0%
I agree so yeah the cap is actually missed I believe it's missing decimals

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:41.329 align:start position:0%
missed I believe it's missing decimals for the

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:44.569 align:start position:0%
for the the non-wrapped case

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
the non-wrapped case um and the idea there uh was that you

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.790 align:start position:0%
um and the idea there uh was that you know you the user could specify whatever

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
know you the user could specify whatever whatever they want but we should specify

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.829 align:start position:0%
whatever they want but we should specify uh a standard and I don't we haven't

00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:57.470 align:start position:0%
uh a standard and I don't we haven't discussed that yet this still depends on

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.269 align:start position:0%
discussed that yet this still depends on the discussion that you know we moved

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:01.670 align:start position:0%
the discussion that you know we moved from big into U1 128 but I think there's

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.050 align:start position:0%
from big into U1 128 but I think there's still some uh

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.850 align:start position:0%
still some uh discussions have to go on there with

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.310 align:start position:0%
discussions have to go on there with what we think a default decimal should

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.889 align:start position:0%
what we think a default decimal should be

00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:14.990 align:start position:0%
um so

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:21.290 align:start position:0%
maybe we can start by is there anyone that objects to u128 as the as a

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.150 align:start position:0%
that objects to u128 as the as a standard token contract

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.590 align:start position:0%
standard token contract um

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:36.050 align:start position:0%
um uh number type

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.810 align:start position:0%
okay going gone okay and so that's moot's next question

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.090 align:start position:0%
okay and so that's moot's next question for the auth required Solutions when we

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.470 align:start position:0%
for the auth required Solutions when we run into weird situations where only

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.629 align:start position:0%
run into weird situations where only Stellar accounts can participate or

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.550 align:start position:0%
Stellar accounts can participate or other non-auth required built-in tokens

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.490 align:start position:0%
other non-auth required built-in tokens support Stellar accounts contracts and

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.009 align:start position:0%
support Stellar accounts contracts and basic 825519 keys

00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:56.870 align:start position:0%
basic 825519 keys I

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.449 align:start position:0%
I I can't think of a reason why this would

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:02.030 align:start position:0%
I can't think of a reason why this would happen off the top of my head uh there's

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:02.749 align:start position:0%
happen off the top of my head uh there's no

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:05.329 align:start position:0%
no difference

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.789 align:start position:0%
you know this author required mechanism that I mentioned and a identifier that

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:11.809 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned and a identifier that is

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.890 align:start position:0%
is is the authorized so I'm not I can't

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.110 align:start position:0%
is the authorized so I'm not I can't think of uh an example like this if you

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.270 align:start position:0%
think of uh an example like this if you have one let me know and I can

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.370 align:start position:0%
have one let me know and I can think about that

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.350 align:start position:0%
think about that uh what about looking at wrapped smart

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh what about looking at wrapped smart contract as an on off ramp I'm not sure

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:42.110 align:start position:0%
contract as an on off ramp I'm not sure uh what that what that means

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.930 align:start position:0%
okay yeah

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:50.210 align:start position:0%
yeah Lee

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.850 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just thinking about the term callback and and you know if that is a

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.650 align:start position:0%
callback and and you know if that is a problematic term I mean it's I feel like

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.590 align:start position:0%
problematic term I mean it's I feel like the term is understood in other

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.690 align:start position:0%
the term is understood in other Financial

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.230 align:start position:0%
Financial uh ecosystems um but maybe yeah if it if

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.270 align:start position:0%
uh ecosystems um but maybe yeah if it if it's not a good term to be using sort of

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
it's not a good term to be using sort of going forward in a in a blockchain world

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.450 align:start position:0%
going forward in a in a blockchain world um

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.930 align:start position:0%
here would it be termed because do you think if if we said that the admin could

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.390 align:start position:0%
think if if we said that the admin could do a transfer from one from any account

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.890 align:start position:0%
do a transfer from one from any account to any account like it's sort of the

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.289 align:start position:0%
to any account like it's sort of the same thing as clawback

00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:26.630 align:start position:0%
same thing as clawback um and it's sort of maybe bad to do that

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.549 align:start position:0%
um and it's sort of maybe bad to do that because we're overloading an operation

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:31.190 align:start position:0%
because we're overloading an operation that can suddenly do

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.130 align:start position:0%
that can suddenly do something that might be surprising

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.890 align:start position:0%
something that might be surprising um yeah I'm one way to like try to

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.169 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm one way to like try to eliminate that term without needing to

00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:40.909 align:start position:0%
eliminate that term without needing to replace it

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.549 align:start position:0%
replace it yeah I mean that sounds

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:46.789 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that sounds um like a little more complex right

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.049 align:start position:0%
um like a little more complex right um it's not even the same thing because

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
um it's not even the same thing because in club in the cloud back the balance

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:50.810 align:start position:0%
in club in the cloud back the balance gets burned right which is how it works

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.090 align:start position:0%
gets burned right which is how it works on classic and currently in the token

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
on classic and currently in the token contract

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.150 align:start position:0%
contract um in your example it wouldn't get

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.650 align:start position:0%
um in your example it wouldn't get burned right it would get sent to

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.730 align:start position:0%
burned right it would get sent to another address I guess you could send

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.350 align:start position:0%
another address I guess you could send it to the zero eighty two five five one

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.090 align:start position:0%
it to the zero eighty two five five one nine key

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.950 align:start position:0%
nine key um I I think this is something we should

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.529 align:start position:0%
um I I think this is something we should discuss because to me you know clawback

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
discuss because to me you know clawback already exists on Stellar right so and

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.710 align:start position:0%
already exists on Stellar right so and it works

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.890 align:start position:0%
it works almost the same on sorbon so it made

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.890 align:start position:0%
almost the same on sorbon so it made sense to me to to change the name but uh

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.169 align:start position:0%
sense to me to to change the name but uh if enough people it like I think it's

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
if enough people it like I think it's something we should discuss

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.930 align:start position:0%
something we should discuss yeah I'm yeah I'm not I personally think

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.789 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm yeah I'm not I personally think clawback's probably fine because we

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:28.789 align:start position:0%
clawback's probably fine because we already have that definition and I think

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:31.190 align:start position:0%
already have that definition and I think it sounds like the folks who are

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.990 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the folks who are planning to use

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.730 align:start position:0%
planning to use um this today already understand what it

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.230 align:start position:0%
um this today already understand what it means

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.549 align:start position:0%
means um

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:40.430 align:start position:0%
um uh sorry I have a bit of a question on a

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.890 align:start position:0%
uh sorry I have a bit of a question on a tangent to why you just mentioned you

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.390 align:start position:0%
tangent to why you just mentioned you said that

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.810 align:start position:0%
said that uh so callback

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.450 align:start position:0%
uh so callback what so on Stella if you transfer to the

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.370 align:start position:0%
what so on Stella if you transfer to the issuer you're essentially burning

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.730 align:start position:0%
issuer you're essentially burning because the answer disappears because

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.529 align:start position:0%
because the answer disappears because the issue can't hold the balance of the

00:19:57.539 --> 00:19:59.630 align:start position:0%
the issue can't hold the balance of the asset the issue um what happens if you

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.049 align:start position:0%
asset the issue um what happens if you transfer to the admin I get the or

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:05.870 align:start position:0%
transfer to the admin I get the or transferred to the issuer

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.490 align:start position:0%
transferred to the issuer um on the sorbin

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.289 align:start position:0%
um on the sorbin ation

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:11.630 align:start position:0%
ation it doesn't get burnt it just it updates

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.690 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get burnt it just it updates the issue with balance like the issue or

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.370 align:start position:0%
the issue with balance like the issue or the admin account doesn't have

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.350 align:start position:0%
the admin account doesn't have any exception when it comes to like

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
any exception when it comes to like transfers or anything like that

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:26.090 align:start position:0%
big other things

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.789 align:start position:0%
so

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.150 align:start position:0%
authorized trust and inheritance classic in case you need a slower account detain

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:41.210 align:start position:0%
authorized flag so that that is how it works on classic like uh you need the

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.029 align:start position:0%
works on classic like uh you need the trust line to to get authorized by the

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:45.710 align:start position:0%
trust line to to get authorized by the issuer

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.289 align:start position:0%
issuer um and on sorbon we would imitate the

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:50.810 align:start position:0%
um and on sorbon we would imitate the same at the the admin or the the admin

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.970 align:start position:0%
same at the the admin or the the admin on sorbond would need to explicitly

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.409 align:start position:0%
on sorbond would need to explicitly authorize

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.090 align:start position:0%
authorize on sorobon we'll have we have this

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.409 align:start position:0%
on sorobon we'll have we have this method called authorize and we'll

00:20:57.419 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
method called authorize and we'll authorize that balance

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
um does that answer your question oops

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
okay

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.610 align:start position:0%
and I the the naming there like maybe you need to think about that

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.810 align:start position:0%
like maybe you need to think about that some more about the fact that there's

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.370 align:start position:0%
some more about the fact that there's you know you have you can authorize it

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.190 align:start position:0%
you know you have you can authorize it on classic I mean also authorize on

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
on classic I mean also authorize on sorbond but server authorization doesn't

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.450 align:start position:0%
sorbond but server authorization doesn't work the same like it's much simpler

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.070 align:start position:0%
work the same like it's much simpler than

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:35.210 align:start position:0%
than design

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.630 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate what's the differences just so we're all clear on

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.169 align:start position:0%
differences just so we're all clear on that uh yeah so you know in classic you

00:21:42.179 --> 00:21:43.610 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah so you know in classic you can uh there's a lot of different levels

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.169 align:start position:0%
can uh there's a lot of different levels of authorization uh that's what I mean

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:46.850 align:start position:0%
of authorization uh that's what I mean you can have uh you know fully

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
you can have uh you know fully authorized through the authorized you

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.930 align:start position:0%
authorized through the authorized you can be uh

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
can be uh you can authorize to maintain

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.350 align:start position:0%
you can authorize to maintain liabilities right maintain offers and

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.930 align:start position:0%
liabilities right maintain offers and liquidity pool uh deposits but you can't

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.490 align:start position:0%
liquidity pool uh deposits but you can't do anything with your balance

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.070 align:start position:0%
do anything with your balance and I believe there's also a flag that

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.690 align:start position:0%
and I believe there's also a flag that says you can actually cloud back from

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.470 align:start position:0%
says you can actually cloud back from the

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
the trust line uh and that flag is

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.029 align:start position:0%
trust line uh and that flag is maintained

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:09.950 align:start position:0%
maintained currently in the proposal in soroban

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.330 align:start position:0%
currently in the proposal in soroban like the clawback flag but it's at the

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.130 align:start position:0%
like the clawback flag but it's at the contract level and not at a balanced

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.130 align:start position:0%
contract level and not at a balanced level uh because my the thought process

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
level uh because my the thought process was I don't think it needs to be at the

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.130 align:start position:0%
was I don't think it needs to be at the balance level and it would add a lot

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.169 align:start position:0%
balance level and it would add a lot more complexity

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:33.529 align:start position:0%
more complexity um but yeah those are the differences

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:47.169 align:start position:0%
all right any uh any other questions any concerns

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
do you have the answers that you need to move forward

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.390 align:start position:0%
I believe I do uh so before the author choir uh solution I think I I need to

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.130 align:start position:0%
choir uh solution I think I I need to rework what I have a little bits to make

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
rework what I have a little bits to make sure that the

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.549 align:start position:0%
um the non-wrap scenario doesn't doesn't change or get any worse

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
change or get any worse um

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.310 align:start position:0%
um um other than that it doesn't sound like

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.649 align:start position:0%
um other than that it doesn't sound like oh that and I need I should like naming

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:17.870 align:start position:0%
oh that and I need I should like naming right looking at burnt versus clawback

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
right looking at burnt versus clawback in the ecosystem

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.010 align:start position:0%
in the ecosystem uh yeah about other than those two

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.149 align:start position:0%
uh yeah about other than those two things I don't think there's anything

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
things I don't think there's anything else

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:30.230 align:start position:0%
else I need to look at

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:35.090 align:start position:0%
well I think there is maybe like a symmetry uh question there right like uh

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.730 align:start position:0%
symmetry uh question there right like uh that I I was just thinking about that is

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.710 align:start position:0%
that I I was just thinking about that is when I think of the building token

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.770 align:start position:0%
when I think of the building token contract versus the uh more generic uh

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.690 align:start position:0%
contract versus the uh more generic uh interface right that we are exposing

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.610 align:start position:0%
interface right that we are exposing that people can use when they

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.350 align:start position:0%
that people can use when they uh implement the the contract

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.310 align:start position:0%
isn't there like um if we have like this auth required thing right like it

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.990 align:start position:0%
auth required thing right like it basically limits

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.570 align:start position:0%
basically limits the the the way you can

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
the the the way you can um do payments right uh from the outside

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
um do payments right uh from the outside so like is

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.070 align:start position:0%
so like is is that pointing to like a

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.529 align:start position:0%
is that pointing to like a I don't know like having um

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:11.750 align:start position:0%
I don't know like having um it's basically an implicit

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.450 align:start position:0%
it's basically an implicit um uh like uh

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.850 align:start position:0%
um uh like uh like yeah like hook you know I know the

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
like yeah like hook you know I know the original cap had like this uh like

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.070 align:start position:0%
original cap had like this uh like section on cooks are evil you know we

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.649 align:start position:0%
section on cooks are evil you know we should never do that but uh at the same

00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:26.930 align:start position:0%
should never do that but uh at the same time this looks like actually like a

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.850 align:start position:0%
time this looks like actually like a hook to me uh that happens to be a

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.070 align:start position:0%
hook to me uh that happens to be a classic hook

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
classic hook uh and I'm just wondering like when we

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.230 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm just wondering like when we say also that uh people that are that

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.549 align:start position:0%
say also that uh people that are that are today

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.049 align:start position:0%
are today um looking at implementing Earth

00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:42.049 align:start position:0%
um looking at implementing Earth required assets want to

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:44.810 align:start position:0%
required assets want to move uh some of the functionality into

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.610 align:start position:0%
move uh some of the functionality into soroban

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.549 align:start position:0%
soroban are they really going to be satisfied

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
are they really going to be satisfied with those limited semantics as opposed

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.870 align:start position:0%
with those limited semantics as opposed to I know like a lot of the the things

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.310 align:start position:0%
to I know like a lot of the the things that people were asking in the past

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.529 align:start position:0%
that people were asking in the past around programmatic you know being able

00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:00.169 align:start position:0%
around programmatic you know being able to basically control the flow of assets

00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:03.529 align:start position:0%
to basically control the flow of assets was hey I want to put limits you know on

00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:06.770 align:start position:0%
was hey I want to put limits you know on uh on transaction uh on transactions

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.690 align:start position:0%
uh on transaction uh on transactions like you know you can only move ten

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.130 align:start position:0%
like you know you can only move ten thousand dollars a day or whatever right

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day or whatever right like things like that

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.390 align:start position:0%
like things like that so yeah wondering about that uh where

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.770 align:start position:0%
so yeah wondering about that uh where does that fit in this picture

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.390 align:start position:0%
the you know the first requirement uh at least I was that I was following is that

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.310 align:start position:0%
least I was that I was following is that you you'd like to be able to support

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.470 align:start position:0%
you you'd like to be able to support anything that can happen on classic

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.110 align:start position:0%
anything that can happen on classic uh in soroban right in the bold and tone

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.669 align:start position:0%
uh in soroban right in the bold and tone contract which is the you know the goal

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
contract which is the you know the goal of adding support throughout the

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.850 align:start position:0%
of adding support throughout the Acquired and clawback

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.310 align:start position:0%
Acquired and clawback um what you're saying is an interesting

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.090 align:start position:0%
um what you're saying is an interesting idea uh adding hooks to soak admin's uh

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.269 align:start position:0%
idea uh adding hooks to soak admin's uh can customize what happens uh but one

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:46.130 align:start position:0%
can customize what happens uh but one you know one concern there is

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.649 align:start position:0%
you know one concern there is you would you would end up executing

00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:51.289 align:start position:0%
you would you would end up executing like the the uh one of the nice things

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:52.850 align:start position:0%
like the the uh one of the nice things with the built-in tone contract is built

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.590 align:start position:0%
with the built-in tone contract is built in right it doesn't execute wasn't but

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.269 align:start position:0%
in right it doesn't execute wasn't but if you have these hooks they would be in

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:58.610 align:start position:0%
if you have these hooks they would be in wasm right so you would you take the

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.409 align:start position:0%
wasm right so you would you take the performance set

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.750 align:start position:0%
performance set um and in that case I I don't know you

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.430 align:start position:0%
um and in that case I I don't know you could argue that

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.169 align:start position:0%
could argue that they should you should be using a

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:07.789 align:start position:0%
they should you should be using a different tone contract altogether like

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:10.730 align:start position:0%
different tone contract altogether like one that just adheres to the interface

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.070 align:start position:0%
one that just adheres to the interface uh do you agree on that

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.810 align:start position:0%
uh do you agree on that you mean like yeah yeah I guess like as

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.490 align:start position:0%
you mean like yeah yeah I guess like as soon as you have hooks you can't do like

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.890 align:start position:0%
soon as you have hooks you can't do like a classic payment for example because

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
a classic payment for example because you're bypassing the hook is that what

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.690 align:start position:0%
you're bypassing the hook is that what you're talking about

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.549 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I'm I'm not sure what you mean by that

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:27.950 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure what you mean by that I'm saying that if you add a hook the

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.870 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that if you add a hook the hook would be in wasn't right

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.490 align:start position:0%
hook would be in wasn't right like you've called into another contract

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
like you've called into another contract yeah so for the built-in yeah I guess

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.529 align:start position:0%
yeah so for the built-in yeah I guess for like the uh default Behavior you

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:38.750 align:start position:0%
for like the uh default Behavior you would yeah he would just call the

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.310 align:start position:0%
would yeah he would just call the built-in token contract that would have

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
built-in token contract that would have a default implementation right to

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.330 align:start position:0%
a default implementation right to implement those uh what required type of

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.890 align:start position:0%
implement those uh what required type of semantics but

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
semantics but I could see

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.450 align:start position:0%
I could see like the need for maybe like final

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
like the need for maybe like final control uh in general and uh

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.930 align:start position:0%
control uh in general and uh oh the Fire Control that we would

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.430 align:start position:0%
oh the Fire Control that we would provide later on

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.850 align:start position:0%
provide later on or that like anything issuers would want

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.610 align:start position:0%
or that like anything issuers would want to uh yeah to have

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.870 align:start position:0%
to uh yeah to have yeah

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.970 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess maybe those end up just being

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.190 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe those end up just being like separate you know they are not

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.690 align:start position:0%
like separate you know they are not using the built-in token contract at

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.070 align:start position:0%
using the built-in token contract at that point so that's kind of what I'm

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.990 align:start position:0%
that point so that's kind of what I'm trying to wonder I'm wondering about is

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.630 align:start position:0%
trying to wonder I'm wondering about is like those use cases without required

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.610 align:start position:0%
like those use cases without required Assets in suraban

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.289 align:start position:0%
Assets in suraban they are not people are not going to be

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:23.450 align:start position:0%
they are not people are not going to be able to actually implement

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.370 align:start position:0%
able to actually implement I think the type of things that I'm

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.409 align:start position:0%
I think the type of things that I'm looking after that is like uh like I

00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
looking after that is like uh like I said like uh people asked before the the

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.470 align:start position:0%
said like uh people asked before the the feature requests are on the the hooks

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.409 align:start position:0%
feature requests are on the the hooks were things like uh maximum our

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:39.529 align:start position:0%
were things like uh maximum our conditions on the transaction right like

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
conditions on the transaction right like uh uh not just it was not just a flag it

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.269 align:start position:0%
uh uh not just it was not just a flag it was basically like you know open-ended

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:45.950 align:start position:0%
was basically like you know open-ended type of conditions

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.590 align:start position:0%
type of conditions and then use the built-in token contract

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
and then use the built-in token contract which may be okay but you know I then

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.010 align:start position:0%
which may be okay but you know I then I'm kind of questioning the

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.630 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of questioning the are you talking about uh from the

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.610 align:start position:0%
are you talking about uh from the perspective on net new issuers or from

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
perspective on net new issuers or from the perspective of existing issuers that

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.090 align:start position:0%
the perspective of existing issuers that want to introduce

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
want to introduce um new constraints or like new yeah

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.169 align:start position:0%
um new constraints or like new yeah that's kind of I'm just wondering like

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:08.450 align:start position:0%
that's kind of I'm just wondering like like the people that have like those uh

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.890 align:start position:0%
like the people that have like those uh like uh as um out required assets

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.049 align:start position:0%
like uh as um out required assets if they think that they can basically

00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:17.450 align:start position:0%
if they think that they can basically over time add more conditions this is

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.570 align:start position:0%
over time add more conditions this is actually not going to work

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.649 align:start position:0%
right you got it so to some extent I hear like a question to Jake if it's

00:28:27.659 --> 00:28:29.269 align:start position:0%
hear like a question to Jake if it's still here which is

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:31.010 align:start position:0%
still here which is uh you know these new issuers that are

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.210 align:start position:0%
uh you know these new issuers that are coming on board and are interesting and

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.850 align:start position:0%
coming on board and are interesting and auth required uh assets maybe the

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.409 align:start position:0%
auth required uh assets maybe the solution for them

00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:40.010 align:start position:0%
solution for them is to actually issue a custom contract

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.610 align:start position:0%
is to actually issue a custom contract on soroban rather than

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.130 align:start position:0%
on soroban rather than an off-acquired acid on classic and kind

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.409 align:start position:0%
an off-acquired acid on classic and kind of like trying to constrain it to be

00:28:48.419 --> 00:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
of like trying to constrain it to be what they want it to be

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.730 align:start position:0%
yeah we we've talked about you know something similar with like uh regulated

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
something similar with like uh regulated assets assets that need much more

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.070 align:start position:0%
assets assets that need much more defined Grant control

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.450 align:start position:0%
defined Grant control um and in those cases I think it makes

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.930 align:start position:0%
um and in those cases I think it makes sense to to use a new token contract

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.490 align:start position:0%
sense to to use a new token contract all right the middle to the built-in

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.409 align:start position:0%
all right the middle to the built-in tone contract can't do everything right

00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:12.409 align:start position:0%
tone contract can't do everything right and I don't think adding these I don't

00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:13.850 align:start position:0%
and I don't think adding these I don't think adding these hooks is a good idea

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.850 align:start position:0%
think adding these hooks is a good idea into the built-in token contract

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.630 align:start position:0%
into the built-in token contract um yeah just uh my opinion

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.169 align:start position:0%
yeah I think their position should be that if you want these type of uh

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.610 align:start position:0%
that if you want these type of uh conditions and restraints you should

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.610 align:start position:0%
conditions and restraints you should definitely deploy your own

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.830 align:start position:0%
definitely deploy your own um contract that adheres to the standard

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.510 align:start position:0%
um contract that adheres to the standard token interface you know assembly that

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.769 align:start position:0%
token interface you know assembly that we're seeing in ethereum and other

00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:55.310 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in ethereum and other ecosystems

00:29:57.659 --> 00:29:59.870 align:start position:0%
okay so let me um you know said I think we're we're at

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
um you know said I think we're we're at a relatively good place with this with

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:03.289 align:start position:0%
a relatively good place with this with this cap

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
this cap um I do think there's a

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.130 align:start position:0%
um I do think there's a there's like this parallel discussion

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.470 align:start position:0%
there's like this parallel discussion that probably hasn't matured to bringing

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.450 align:start position:0%
that probably hasn't matured to bringing it up right now on

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.889 align:start position:0%
it up right now on uh you know this versus like a more

00:30:14.899 --> 00:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh you know this versus like a more discussions uh you know we we abandoned

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.130 align:start position:0%
discussions uh you know we we abandoned a few months ago to make progress but we

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
a few months ago to make progress but we need to go back to in terms of

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.570 align:start position:0%
need to go back to in terms of um you know single balance versus two

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.909 align:start position:0%
um you know single balance versus two balance approach

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:27.970 align:start position:0%
balance approach um but I think we need to have a better

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.169 align:start position:0%
um but I think we need to have a better understanding of what the

00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:32.570 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the possibilities are there

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.029 align:start position:0%
possibilities are there uh before we can actually

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:37.610 align:start position:0%
uh before we can actually make like a

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.990 align:start position:0%
make like a um you know like the go-ahead decision

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
um you know like the go-ahead decision with regards to this specific uh cap

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.909 align:start position:0%
with regards to this specific uh cap yeah I agree

00:30:52.080 --> 00:31:03.889 align:start position:0%
anything else anyone wants to discuss or are we done for the day

00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:08.149 align:start position:0%
okay cool I think

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
we might be done

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:14.450 align:start position:0%
um I'm just checking the live chat to see if there are any unanswered

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.750 align:start position:0%
see if there are any unanswered questions there's one more from moods

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.610 align:start position:0%
questions there's one more from moods which is in the event issuers are pushed

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.370 align:start position:0%
which is in the event issuers are pushed to write a custom token contract would

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.350 align:start position:0%
to write a custom token contract would there be any core support to migrate

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
there be any core support to migrate between a classic slash custom token

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.909 align:start position:0%
between a classic slash custom token I would I would say no uh

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:33.889 align:start position:0%
I would I would say no uh that's an interesting question but my

00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question but my intuition would be that you know you're

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.970 align:start position:0%
intuition would be that you know you're trying to do something that

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
trying to do something that uh

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.690 align:start position:0%
uh you know it isn't even supported in

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.909 align:start position:0%
you know it isn't even supported in classic

00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:46.310 align:start position:0%
classic so it makes sense to be a separate token

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense to be a separate token uh but that's something that we need to

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
uh but that's something that we need to think about more yeah I haven't thought

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:53.450 align:start position:0%
think about more yeah I haven't thought much about how uh you know how these

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.769 align:start position:0%
much about how uh you know how these custom

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:59.090 align:start position:0%
custom uh token contracts would work

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.010 align:start position:0%
and so this isn't and uh responds to mooch's question on how

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.690 align:start position:0%
responds to mooch's question on how these uh if there would be core support

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.889 align:start position:0%
these uh if there would be core support between

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:10.669 align:start position:0%
between class and custom tokens

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:14.389 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this is an interesting question because uh with the built-in

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:17.450 align:start position:0%
question because uh with the built-in contract that we have now uh you there

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.570 align:start position:0%
contract that we have now uh you there is a swap essentially a swap capability

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.430 align:start position:0%
is a swap essentially a swap capability you have the import export

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.889 align:start position:0%
you have the import export functions which you know allow you to

00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:26.510 align:start position:0%
functions which you know allow you to essentially swap

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
essentially swap a token in classic with one in sorbon

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.149 align:start position:0%
a token in classic with one in sorbon and if we are if the story that we're

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.649 align:start position:0%
and if we are if the story that we're developing

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:35.330 align:start position:0%
developing um is that if you want to you know be

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.130 align:start position:0%
um is that if you want to you know be able to build

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.029 align:start position:0%
able to build um

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.610 align:start position:0%
um a custom token that provides all these

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
a custom token that provides all these custom auth auth required type

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.230 align:start position:0%
custom auth auth required type capabilities

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.149 align:start position:0%
capabilities um I think we do need to have some sort

00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:48.830 align:start position:0%
um I think we do need to have some sort of story for how do you replicate that

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.049 align:start position:0%
of story for how do you replicate that import export how do you swap something

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
import export how do you swap something that's on classic with something that is

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.090 align:start position:0%
that's on classic with something that is over on Sovereign so that

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.010 align:start position:0%
over on Sovereign so that um because I can imagine that issuers

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.049 align:start position:0%
um because I can imagine that issuers even if they want that more custom

00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:03.409 align:start position:0%
even if they want that more custom capability on sarban they probably still

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
capability on sarban they probably still want to get access to things like the

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.549 align:start position:0%
want to get access to things like the things on classic like they probably

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:09.470 align:start position:0%
things on classic like they probably don't want to be siled into only the

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.210 align:start position:0%
don't want to be siled into only the sorrow and ecosystem

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.690 align:start position:0%
sorrow and ecosystem yeah that's a good point

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.490 align:start position:0%
and without something without some sort of swap capability and without the

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.710 align:start position:0%
of swap capability and without the ability to

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.909 align:start position:0%
ability to because we're not we're not going to

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:25.250 align:start position:0%
because we're not we're not going to allow classic operations and solvent

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.570 align:start position:0%
allow classic operations and solvent operations to run in the same

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.509 align:start position:0%
operations to run in the same transaction I think we're talking about

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:31.430 align:start position:0%
transaction I think we're talking about some sort of off-chain

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.470 align:start position:0%
some sort of off-chain swap capability which sort of it's not

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.889 align:start position:0%
swap capability which sort of it's not great

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.289 align:start position:0%
yeah this is something to think about like we you know you and I'm not sure

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:43.850 align:start position:0%
like we you know you and I'm not sure how this would work but you could offer

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.889 align:start position:0%
how this would work but you could offer uh import export big host functions but

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:46.970 align:start position:0%
uh import export big host functions but that

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.529 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't sound like a good idea to

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a good idea to me

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.690 align:start position:0%
me but uh

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.690 align:start position:0%
but uh or do it off chain as like you mentioned

00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:13.849 align:start position:0%
or do it off chain as like you mentioned um yeah it's something to think about

00:34:13.859 --> 00:34:21.950 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:26.690 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like there's on

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
on one new one in the live chat from

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.629 align:start position:0%
one new one in the live chat from Demetrio Stellar um why not just have

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.310 align:start position:0%
Demetrio Stellar um why not just have the same sort of one-to-one swap between

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.770 align:start position:0%
the same sort of one-to-one swap between the rap classic asset token and the new

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.329 align:start position:0%
the rap classic asset token and the new token

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:40.790 align:start position:0%
token not the best ux but it's doable right

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:49.730 align:start position:0%
not the best ux but it's doable right now

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh I I think you'd have I I gotta think about this you might have issues with

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.149 align:start position:0%
about this you might have issues with like how would you do a lot like that

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.910 align:start position:0%
like how would you do a lot like that would have to exist as a

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.490 align:start position:0%
would have to exist as a wait no I'm not I'm not sure how if that

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.990 align:start position:0%
wait no I'm not I'm not sure how if that would work like you would have to call

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.430 align:start position:0%
would work like you would have to call import export

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.050 align:start position:0%
import export uh and like and like if I write a

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.030 align:start position:0%
uh and like and like if I write a contract right now Custom Contract I

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.910 align:start position:0%
contract right now Custom Contract I wouldn't be able to call that right

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.550 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to call that right well I think the the issuer there would

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
well I think the the issuer there would be the contract right

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.250 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh yeah yeah

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.069 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right so you don't actually need special

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:27.290 align:start position:0%
right so you don't actually need special anything it just uh happens that yeah

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.329 align:start position:0%
anything it just uh happens that yeah like the

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:32.150 align:start position:0%
like the that that's true you would have complete

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.790 align:start position:0%
that that's true you would have complete control over it well it's yeah complete

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.870 align:start position:0%
control over it well it's yeah complete control now because you can get the

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:43.069 align:start position:0%
control now because you can get the authorized but yeah that's true

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:54.890 align:start position:0%
okay yeah let me let me think about this

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.010 align:start position:0%
okay it feels like we're sort of winding down here

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.890 align:start position:0%
down here um so I I think we're done for the day

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.410 align:start position:0%
what we're doing what we're talking about so that um everyone can sort of

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.810 align:start position:0%
about so that um everyone can sort of get a bit of context for the discussion
