00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.230 align:start position:0%
so without further Ado we're going to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.670 align:start position:0%
without further Ado we're going to keep talking about State expiration

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.810 align:start position:0%
keep talking about State expiration today and I think Garen dropped a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.750 align:start position:0%
today and I think Garen dropped a bit of a bomb a couple of days ago so

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
bit of a bomb a couple of days ago so I think we're gonna start with that and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.709 align:start position:0%
I think we're gonna start with that and again if you can give us a quick

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 align:start position:0%
again if you can give us a quick overview of some of the suggested

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.490 align:start position:0%
overview of some of the suggested changes

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
changes yeah sure so up until this point

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.529 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so up until this point the current Legacy expiration

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.689 align:start position:0%
the current Legacy expiration proposal has had this thing called a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 align:start position:0%
proposal has had this thing called a rent balance so essentially what you

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.349 align:start position:0%
rent balance so essentially what you would do is that whenever you you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
would do is that whenever you you know create an entry or want to do a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.610 align:start position:0%
know create an entry or want to do a rent bump you would put xlm into this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
rent bump you would put xlm into this rent balance and then every Ledger a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
rent balance and then every Ledger a variable amount of a fee called the rent

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.810 align:start position:0%
variable amount of a fee called the rent fee would be removed from this rent

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.209 align:start position:0%
fee would be removed from this rent balance and the rent feed could either

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.369 align:start position:0%
balance and the rent feed could either decrease or increase based on the size

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.770 align:start position:0%
decrease or increase based on the size of the bucket list and network usage

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 align:start position:0%
of the bucket list and network usage so the reasoning behind this initially

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 align:start position:0%
so the reasoning behind this initially was that we want to provide some sort of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 align:start position:0%
was that we want to provide some sort of market equilibrium that as The Bucket

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.970 align:start position:0%
market equilibrium that as The Bucket List gets larger and as the price of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 align:start position:0%
List gets larger and as the price of writing to the bucket list increases we

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 align:start position:0%
writing to the bucket list increases we also have increased pressure to evict

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 align:start position:0%
also have increased pressure to evict and expire entries out of the bucket

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
and expire entries out of the bucket list and so the thinking with this kind

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.429 align:start position:0%
list and so the thinking with this kind of variable rent fee is that as the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
of variable rent fee is that as the Buckle list grows you the rent fee also

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.590 align:start position:0%
Buckle list grows you the rent fee also grows and so that you deduct rent

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
grows and so that you deduct rent balance more aggressively and so more

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.550 align:start position:0%
balance more aggressively and so more entries will fall to zero or negative

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170 align:start position:0%
entries will fall to zero or negative rent balances and then be expired more

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.969 align:start position:0%
rent balances and then be expired more frequently so that's kind of the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.590 align:start position:0%
frequently so that's kind of the original thinking as to why we had this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 align:start position:0%
original thinking as to why we had this variable rent balance and this variable

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 align:start position:0%
variable rent balance and this variable rent fee now the issue with that is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 align:start position:0%
rent fee now the issue with that is there's two primary issues the first is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
there's two primary issues the first is just the user experience story so with

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
just the user experience story so with run balance because the rent fee that's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490 align:start position:0%
run balance because the rent fee that's deducted is variable from ledger to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 align:start position:0%
deducted is variable from ledger to Ledger you can estimate how many ledgers

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.450 align:start position:0%
Ledger you can estimate how many ledgers you think your entry will be live on the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.130 align:start position:0%
you think your entry will be live on the network but you can't know for certain

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 align:start position:0%
network but you can't know for certain so for instance say if you initially

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.810 align:start position:0%
so for instance say if you initially paid for 100 ledgers of rent

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.130 align:start position:0%
paid for 100 ledgers of rent but you know there are a bunch of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050 align:start position:0%
but you know there are a bunch of merges so the bucket list size decreased

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.969 align:start position:0%
merges so the bucket list size decreased a lot then your entry could live much

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.730 align:start position:0%
a lot then your entry could live much longer conversely if you paid for say 10

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 align:start position:0%
longer conversely if you paid for say 10 years of rent your entry might only

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
years of rent your entry might only lasts one year if the network explodes

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.410 align:start position:0%
lasts one year if the network explodes in popularity and the Buckle of size

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.050 align:start position:0%
in popularity and the Buckle of size increases and so it's kind of weird user

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
increases and so it's kind of weird user interface where the users expect an

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.469 align:start position:0%
interface where the users expect an entry's lifetime to be measured in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.570 align:start position:0%
entry's lifetime to be measured in ledgers but really you have like this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 align:start position:0%
ledgers but really you have like this rent balance and like this variable

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 align:start position:0%
rent balance and like this variable thing you really can't control it and so

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 align:start position:0%
thing you really can't control it and so that was issue number one is that it was

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 align:start position:0%
that was issue number one is that it was difficult for users to understand and it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.930 align:start position:0%
difficult for users to understand and it didn't have a great user Story the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.729 align:start position:0%
didn't have a great user Story the second issue is that of Downstream

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
second issue is that of Downstream systems and so because the rent fee is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.790 align:start position:0%
systems and so because the rent fee is variable from ledger to Ledger you don't

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.850 align:start position:0%
variable from ledger to Ledger you don't know when or you can't predict what the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.530 align:start position:0%
know when or you can't predict what the Run fee will be and so you cannot

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.650 align:start position:0%
Run fee will be and so you cannot predict an entry's rent balance now in

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 align:start position:0%
predict an entry's rent balance now in Stellar core we have like this bucket

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 align:start position:0%
Stellar core we have like this bucket list data structure which is like you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 align:start position:0%
list data structure which is like you know specially designed with this

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.670 align:start position:0%
know specially designed with this multiple levels and like this log

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.949 align:start position:0%
multiple levels and like this log scripted merge tree approach and we've

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.170 align:start position:0%
scripted merge tree approach and we've designed the rent balance system

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.970 align:start position:0%
designed the rent balance system to work very well with the bucket list

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.130 align:start position:0%
to work very well with the bucket list such that on bucket list and on

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
such that on bucket list and on bucket list DB you always know exactly

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.809 align:start position:0%
bucket list DB you always know exactly how much rent balance your entry has and

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.949 align:start position:0%
how much rent balance your entry has and we can do this efficiently without

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.170 align:start position:0%
we can do this efficiently without iterating through every entry and then

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.729 align:start position:0%
iterating through every entry and then you know decrementing its rent balance

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
you know decrementing its rent balance by the current letters rent fee we

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.449 align:start position:0%
by the current letters rent fee we can like you know get around it using

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.250 align:start position:0%
can like you know get around it using some optimizations of the bucket list

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 align:start position:0%
some optimizations of the bucket list structure now the issue for Downstream

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.229 align:start position:0%
structure now the issue for Downstream systems is that Downstream systems don't

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.750 align:start position:0%
systems is that Downstream systems don't have a copy of the bucket list you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.670 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bucket list you know they're running captive core but

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.530 align:start position:0%
know they're running captive core but the way that a captive Quorum core is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.809 align:start position:0%
the way that a captive Quorum core is currently designed it's too expensive to

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.390 align:start position:0%
currently designed it's too expensive to query a captive core directly and so

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.710 align:start position:0%
query a captive core directly and so that means that in order for these

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
that means that in order for these Downstream systems primarily Horizon

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.690 align:start position:0%
Downstream systems primarily Horizon and sort of on RPC nodes in order for

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.490 align:start position:0%
and sort of on RPC nodes in order for them to have accurate rent balance

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.729 align:start position:0%
them to have accurate rent balance information what they would need is to

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.729 align:start position:0%
information what they would need is to essentially either maintain their own

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.290 align:start position:0%
essentially either maintain their own version of The Bucket List and apply

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.210 align:start position:0%
version of The Bucket List and apply rent via like a copy of the bucket list

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.309 align:start position:0%
rent via like a copy of the bucket list or do some like very inefficient

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.570 align:start position:0%
or do some like very inefficient operations

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.949 align:start position:0%
operations with like SQL where you like

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.710 align:start position:0%
with like SQL where you like essentially cache some amount of rent

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.869 align:start position:0%
essentially cache some amount of rent fees and then lazily apply them in the

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.670 align:start position:0%
fees and then lazily apply them in the background or something like that but in

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.350 align:start position:0%
background or something like that but in either case it's it's a lot of work

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.869 align:start position:0%
either case it's it's a lot of work for Downstream systems a lot of disk i o

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.789 align:start position:0%
for Downstream systems a lot of disk i o and things like that so those are these

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.530 align:start position:0%
and things like that so those are these are the two main drawbacks and so when

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.750 align:start position:0%
are the two main drawbacks and so when thinking about this issue we thought

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.550 align:start position:0%
thinking about this issue we thought from our first principles okay do we

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.170 align:start position:0%
from our first principles okay do we need this variable rent fee do we need a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.449 align:start position:0%
need this variable rent fee do we need a rent balance or can we use a definitive

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
rent balance or can we use a definitive expiration Ledger and so that's kind of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.229 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger and so that's kind of what today's conversation about is rent

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.630 align:start position:0%
what today's conversation about is rent balance versus expiration Ledger now how

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.330 align:start position:0%
balance versus expiration Ledger now how the expiration ledger works is instead

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.370 align:start position:0%
the expiration ledger works is instead of having The Ledger entry store a rent

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.689 align:start position:0%
of having The Ledger entry store a rent balance field that is periodically

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.050 align:start position:0%
balance field that is periodically deducted from instead all it stores is a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.090 align:start position:0%
deducted from instead all it stores is a single entry which is expiration Ledger

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.610 align:start position:0%
single entry which is expiration Ledger it's very simple essentially before the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
it's very simple essentially before the expiration Ledger the entry is live and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.570 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger the entry is live and accessible after the expiration Ledger

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.450 align:start position:0%
accessible after the expiration Ledger the entry has run out of rent and is not

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.689 align:start position:0%
the entry has run out of rent and is not accessible and then once the entry is

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.850 align:start position:0%
accessible and then once the entry is passed this expiration Ledger it can be

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.409 align:start position:0%
passed this expiration Ledger it can be expired which is when it's deleted from

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.909 align:start position:0%
expired which is when it's deleted from The Bucket List and then if it's a

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.350 align:start position:0%
The Bucket List and then if it's a temporary entry it could be permanently

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.330 align:start position:0%
temporary entry it could be permanently deleted or if it's a restorable entry

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.249 align:start position:0%
deleted or if it's a restorable entry it's deleted and then stay sent to a

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.930 align:start position:0%
it's deleted and then stay sent to a state restoration node or something like

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.650 align:start position:0%
state restoration node or something like that

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.170 align:start position:0%
that now the advantages to the expiration

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.270 align:start position:0%
now the advantages to the expiration Ledger approach are that it's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.830 align:start position:0%
Ledger approach are that it's significantly easier for Downstream

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.450 align:start position:0%
significantly easier for Downstream systems because they don't have to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
systems because they don't have to periodically update entries with rent

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.189 align:start position:0%
periodically update entries with rent balance information The Meta that's

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.050 align:start position:0%
balance information The Meta that's initially emitted whenever an entry is

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.850 align:start position:0%
initially emitted whenever an entry is created or an entry receives a rent bump

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
created or an entry receives a rent bump we'll tell Downstream systems exactly

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.050 align:start position:0%
we'll tell Downstream systems exactly when an entry should expire and so it's

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.249 align:start position:0%
when an entry should expire and so it's pretty straightforward from the

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.409 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward from the implementation standpoint it also makes

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.270 align:start position:0%
implementation standpoint it also makes a lot more sense for users who expect

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.370 align:start position:0%
a lot more sense for users who expect that a lifetime is measured in kind of

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.550 align:start position:0%
that a lifetime is measured in kind of Ledger a discrete and predictable values

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.249 align:start position:0%
Ledger a discrete and predictable values now the drawback to this is that we

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.469 align:start position:0%
now the drawback to this is that we can't have this Dynamic eviction

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.090 align:start position:0%
can't have this Dynamic eviction pressure feature that we have in rent

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.969 align:start position:0%
pressure feature that we have in rent balance so how the expiration Ledger

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
balance so how the expiration Ledger implementation will work with respect to

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.930 align:start position:0%
implementation will work with respect to fees is what we would do is take

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.330 align:start position:0%
fees is what we would do is take whatever the current market rent fee

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.590 align:start position:0%
whatever the current market rent fee rate is based on the size of The

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.650 align:start position:0%
rate is based on the size of The Blacklist and then lock that right in

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
Blacklist and then lock that right in and charge that rate for the entire

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.450 align:start position:0%
and charge that rate for the entire lifetime of the object or of the entry

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.490 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the object or of the entry so for instance say you are creating a

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.469 align:start position:0%
so for instance say you are creating a new entry that has one year's worth of

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.689 align:start position:0%
new entry that has one year's worth of rent you would be charged one year's

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.350 align:start position:0%
rent you would be charged one year's worth of rent at the current rent fee

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.629 align:start position:0%
worth of rent at the current rent fee now the issue with this is suppose that

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.550 align:start position:0%
now the issue with this is suppose that within that year The Bucket List size

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.249 align:start position:0%
within that year The Bucket List size increases significantly essentially what

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.689 align:start position:0%
increases significantly essentially what you would be doing is because you locked

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.249 align:start position:0%
you would be doing is because you locked in that rage when the size was small

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.710 align:start position:0%
in that rage when the size was small you'd be paying an artificially low rate

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.050 align:start position:0%
you'd be paying an artificially low rate compared to other entries that are being

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.730 align:start position:0%
compared to other entries that are being added onto the network later

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.490 align:start position:0%
added onto the network later and so you have this weird system where

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.749 align:start position:0%
and so you have this weird system where these entries can be kind of

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
these entries can be kind of grandfathered in so to speak such that

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.129 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in so to speak such that they pay low fees because it's gotten

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
they pay low fees because it's gotten at the ground level when the network is

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.350 align:start position:0%
at the ground level when the network is low

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.050 align:start position:0%
low and so with rent balances you don't have

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.909 align:start position:0%
and so with rent balances you don't have this grandfather thing because even if

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.309 align:start position:0%
this grandfather thing because even if you create an entry on Day Zero answer

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.870 align:start position:0%
you create an entry on Day Zero answer up on launch day when the buck list was

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.629 align:start position:0%
up on launch day when the buck list was at you know theoretical smallest size

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.390 align:start position:0%
at you know theoretical smallest size because every entry is subject to the

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.010 align:start position:0%
because every entry is subject to the same variable rent fee no matter when

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.770 align:start position:0%
same variable rent fee no matter when they were created the old entries and

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.390 align:start position:0%
they were created the old entries and new entries are charged the same rate

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.909 align:start position:0%
new entries are charged the same rate however because you have to essentially

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.770 align:start position:0%
however because you have to essentially lock in the rate on creation time around

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.570 align:start position:0%
lock in the rate on creation time around bump time with an expiration Ledger

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.790 align:start position:0%
bump time with an expiration Ledger approach that's not possible

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.950 align:start position:0%
approach that's not possible and so I think what we want to think

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.749 align:start position:0%
and so I think what we want to think about if we want to make expiration

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.070 align:start position:0%
about if we want to make expiration letters work because I think the two

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.290 align:start position:0%
letters work because I think the two benefits to Downstream systems and to

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
benefits to Downstream systems and to the user experience are very very

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.529 align:start position:0%
the user experience are very very significant benefits and so we should

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:01.790 align:start position:0%
significant benefits and so we should think about expiration Ledges pretty

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.689 align:start position:0%
think about expiration Ledges pretty seriously

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.969 align:start position:0%
seriously I think that we need to make sure I

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.469 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to make sure I think the thing we want to prevent most

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.170 align:start position:0%
think the thing we want to prevent most are kind of two scenarios first where

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.050 align:start position:0%
are kind of two scenarios first where you have a system where users or there's

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.490 align:start position:0%
you have a system where users or there's smart Contracting can essentially

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.950 align:start position:0%
smart Contracting can essentially provide a storage interface for cheaper

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.110 align:start position:0%
provide a storage interface for cheaper than the protocol can if you can imagine

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.350 align:start position:0%
than the protocol can if you can imagine say on day Zero when the bucket list is

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.689 align:start position:0%
say on day Zero when the bucket list is small someone spins up a smart contract

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
small someone spins up a smart contract that has public functions that exactly

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.969 align:start position:0%
that has public functions that exactly mirror the storage functions of that the

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.170 align:start position:0%
mirror the storage functions of that the protocol exposes so you have like you

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
protocol exposes so you have like you know get

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.870 align:start position:0%
know get you know create just the exact same

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.390 align:start position:0%
you know create just the exact same interface but instead of calling it

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.330 align:start position:0%
interface but instead of calling it directly through the sorbon SDK you

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.770 align:start position:0%
directly through the sorbon SDK you would just make a call to a Smart

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.050 align:start position:0%
would just make a call to a Smart contract for your storage needs and so

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.029 align:start position:0%
contract for your storage needs and so what this storage contract could do is

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.129 align:start position:0%
what this storage contract could do is it could just you know buy up say the

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
it could just you know buy up say the maximum amount of Ledger entries

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of Ledger entries possible

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.710 align:start position:0%
possible on day Zero with say like 100 years

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.749 align:start position:0%
on day Zero with say like 100 years of rent or some very large value and

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.370 align:start position:0%
of rent or some very large value and essentially permanently lock in those

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.650 align:start position:0%
essentially permanently lock in those entries for 100 years at the lowest

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.050 align:start position:0%
entries for 100 years at the lowest possible rent fee and then say two or

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.309 align:start position:0%
possible rent fee and then say two or three years down the line you know if

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
three years down the line you know if the Stellar Network explodes and huge

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.089 align:start position:0%
the Stellar Network explodes and huge the rent fee will be significantly

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:07.129 align:start position:0%
the rent fee will be significantly higher and so what this contract can do

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:09.409 align:start position:0%
higher and so what this contract can do is essentially auction off this rent

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.350 align:start position:0%
is essentially auction off this rent space at a artificially low rate and so

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
space at a artificially low rate and so you can essentially use a middleman

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
you can essentially use a middleman contract to get cheaper storage than you

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.050 align:start position:0%
contract to get cheaper storage than you could if you actually went to the

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.150 align:start position:0%
could if you actually went to the protocol directly and so this is really

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.830 align:start position:0%
protocol directly and so this is really bad from a Network Health perspective

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.930 align:start position:0%
bad from a Network Health perspective because essentially every storage call

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.150 align:start position:0%
because essentially every storage call now has to pass this middleman and so

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.890 align:start position:0%
now has to pass this middleman and so you have lots of additional traffic lots

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.869 align:start position:0%
you have lots of additional traffic lots of additional

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.449 align:start position:0%
of additional overhead for serving storage just

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:34.329 align:start position:0%
overhead for serving storage just because essentially you have a bug and

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:36.350 align:start position:0%
because essentially you have a bug and exploitability in the way that you

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.370 align:start position:0%
exploitability in the way that you charge rent

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.709 align:start position:0%
charge rent and so I think to prevent against that

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.570 align:start position:0%
and so I think to prevent against that specific exploit where you have like

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.730 align:start position:0%
specific exploit where you have like these these storage contract

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.130 align:start position:0%
these these storage contract interfaces what you would need is some

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.769 align:start position:0%
interfaces what you would need is some sort of upper bound on the amount of

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.630 align:start position:0%
sort of upper bound on the amount of Ledger or the lifetime of an entry at

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.790 align:start position:0%
Ledger or the lifetime of an entry at any given point essentially the thinking

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.130 align:start position:0%
any given point essentially the thinking being that you know

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.769 align:start position:0%
being that you know if you allow arbitrarily large amounts

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:00.170 align:start position:0%
if you allow arbitrarily large amounts of rent purchases then you could say

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.269 align:start position:0%
of rent purchases then you could say lock in an entry for 100 years which is

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.829 align:start position:0%
lock in an entry for 100 years which is far too long because the price will

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.509 align:start position:0%
far too long because the price will probably significantly increase in that

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:08.150 align:start position:0%
probably significantly increase in that lifetime but if you have a maximum

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.269 align:start position:0%
lifetime but if you have a maximum lifetime of say six months it's unlikely

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:14.509 align:start position:0%
lifetime of say six months it's unlikely that a storage contract interface could

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.850 align:start position:0%
that a storage contract interface could be profitable with only six months

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.590 align:start position:0%
be profitable with only six months difference between the initial rent fee

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.570 align:start position:0%
difference between the initial rent fee paid and then the rent you they'd be

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.910 align:start position:0%
paid and then the rent you they'd be providing their users and so I think the

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.250 align:start position:0%
providing their users and so I think the plan is if we do expiration ledgers is

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.930 align:start position:0%
plan is if we do expiration ledgers is to have a network parameter which is the

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.750 align:start position:0%
to have a network parameter which is the maximum rent or the maximum lifetime of

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.730 align:start position:0%
maximum rent or the maximum lifetime of a given entry on The Ledger and so this

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.870 align:start position:0%
a given entry on The Ledger and so this could be something like six months or

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.370 align:start position:0%
could be something like six months or one year and this would be a network

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.009 align:start position:0%
one year and this would be a network parameter and so what we can do is you

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:39.350 align:start position:0%
parameter and so what we can do is you want this value to be as large as

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
want this value to be as large as possible from a user perspective just so

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.490 align:start position:0%
possible from a user perspective just so you can provide the most flexibility and

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.829 align:start position:0%
you can provide the most flexibility and usability but you want to be small

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.210 align:start position:0%
usability but you want to be small enough such that you don't have these

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.850 align:start position:0%
enough such that you don't have these rent related exploits and so that would

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
rent related exploits and so that would be a number that we can change by a

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.449 align:start position:0%
be a number that we can change by a network vote just so that we can

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.310 align:start position:0%
network vote just so that we can essentially tune this value up or down

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.230 align:start position:0%
essentially tune this value up or down as we see exploits happening on the

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.610 align:start position:0%
as we see exploits happening on the network or as we see that no exploits

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.170 align:start position:0%
network or as we see that no exploits are happening on the network

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.290 align:start position:0%
are happening on the network in addition to this issue we also

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.730 align:start position:0%
in addition to this issue we also kind of like the middleman storage

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.889 align:start position:0%
kind of like the middleman storage contract we also want to make sure that

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:08.210 align:start position:0%
contract we also want to make sure that we're not allowing a bunch of spam

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.910 align:start position:0%
we're not allowing a bunch of spam entries to lock in very low rates take

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.590 align:start position:0%
entries to lock in very low rates take up space on the network and essentially

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
up space on the network and essentially up the price for everyone else that's

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.630 align:start position:0%
up the price for everyone else that's doing legitimate work that's not spam

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
doing legitimate work that's not spam and so you can imagine that on Day Zero

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.710 align:start position:0%
and so you can imagine that on Day Zero when the you know buckless has a small

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.009 align:start position:0%
when the you know buckless has a small you have a bunch of airdrops that take

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:26.690 align:start position:0%
you have a bunch of airdrops that take whatever the maximum lifetime is say six

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
whatever the maximum lifetime is say six months a year or whatever and then

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.829 align:start position:0%
months a year or whatever and then essentially just mint spam airdrop

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.810 align:start position:0%
essentially just mint spam airdrop tokens and tell the bucket list size

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.190 align:start position:0%
tokens and tell the bucket list size increases such that's no longer

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.269 align:start position:0%
increases such that's no longer profitable

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
profitable now the issue with this is that they can

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.410 align:start position:0%
now the issue with this is that they can essentially even though you know each

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.050 align:start position:0%
essentially even though you know each additional spam token they put on the

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.210 align:start position:0%
additional spam token they put on the network raises the rent fees slightly

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
network raises the rent fees slightly for the next spam token they can still

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.769 align:start position:0%
for the next spam token they can still do this very fast and very quickly take

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:50.990 align:start position:0%
do this very fast and very quickly take up the cheapest rent options with all of

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.449 align:start position:0%
up the cheapest rent options with all of this spam and unlike an event balance

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:56.449 align:start position:0%
this spam and unlike an event balance approach even though the spam has caused

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:58.430 align:start position:0%
approach even though the spam has caused the rent fees to be high for everyone

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.069 align:start position:0%
the rent fees to be high for everyone else because the spam did it first they

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:02.569 align:start position:0%
else because the spam did it first they are not subject to those higher fees and

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
are not subject to those higher fees and you can't evict them which means you can

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.410 align:start position:0%
you can't evict them which means you can have like this essentially these

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.990 align:start position:0%
have like this essentially these events where if for whatever reason the

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.730 align:start position:0%
events where if for whatever reason the bucket list size decreases in the rent

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.490 align:start position:0%
bucket list size decreases in the rent fee decreases rapidly you can have all

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.130 align:start position:0%
fee decreases rapidly you can have all these spam tokens kind of come in and

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.170 align:start position:0%
these spam tokens kind of come in and fill the Gap in very quickly get the

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.449 align:start position:0%
fill the Gap in very quickly get the network up to that you know high rent

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:23.630 align:start position:0%
network up to that you know high rent fee rate again at the cost of all of

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
fee rate again at the cost of all of these spam entries taking up more time

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.470 align:start position:0%
these spam entries taking up more time than they probably should

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.210 align:start position:0%
than they probably should and so I think that's probably where I

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.069 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's probably where I want to get the conversation started

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:33.230 align:start position:0%
want to get the conversation started and open up the floor of questions but

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.269 align:start position:0%
and open up the floor of questions but those are the biggest pros and cons

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.610 align:start position:0%
those are the biggest pros and cons of each the pros of rent balance being

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.829 align:start position:0%
of each the pros of rent balance being you know this eviction pressure and

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.290 align:start position:0%
you know this eviction pressure and defining these exploits natively without

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.970 align:start position:0%
defining these exploits natively without like the need for like a maximum rent

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.250 align:start position:0%
like the need for like a maximum rent balance or something like that the con

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.370 align:start position:0%
balance or something like that the con being Downstream systems and usability

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.670 align:start position:0%
being Downstream systems and usability Garand there was a question around

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.769 align:start position:0%
Garand there was a question around the downstream systems can you just

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:56.930 align:start position:0%
the downstream systems can you just quickly outline the the difference or

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.790 align:start position:0%
quickly outline the the difference or specifically with exploration Ledger

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.550 align:start position:0%
specifically with exploration Ledger what would be the downstream systems

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.069 align:start position:0%
what would be the downstream systems kind of like expectations yeah so I

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:06.110 align:start position:0%
kind of like expectations yeah so I think the the the issue with the

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.090 align:start position:0%
think the the the issue with the rent balance versus expiration Ledger is

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.190 align:start position:0%
rent balance versus expiration Ledger is just that an expiration letter we can

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.710 align:start position:0%
just that an expiration letter we can put in meta so that the downstream

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.210 align:start position:0%
put in meta so that the downstream systems can be directly told what the

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.610 align:start position:0%
systems can be directly told what the expiration Ledger is but there's no way

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.410 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger is but there's no way to emit meta for the variable rent

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.850 align:start position:0%
to emit meta for the variable rent balance bombs just because they're too

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.190 align:start position:0%
balance bombs just because they're too frequent so for instance with expiration

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.889 align:start position:0%
frequent so for instance with expiration Ledger just because it's set a single

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:27.050 align:start position:0%
Ledger just because it's set a single time on creation or whenever an entry

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.569 align:start position:0%
time on creation or whenever an entry has its is expiration or its

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
has its is expiration or its lifetime extended what you can do is

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
lifetime extended what you can do is just emit meta that says okay this key

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.509 align:start position:0%
just emit meta that says okay this key has this lifetime and then they start in

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:37.009 align:start position:0%
has this lifetime and then they start in a SQL database and then whenever you

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
a SQL database and then whenever you access that entry you can just spit out

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.910 align:start position:0%
access that entry you can just spit out the lifetime easy and so you can contain

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.889 align:start position:0%
the lifetime easy and so you can contain all that information in meta with rent

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:45.230 align:start position:0%
all that information in meta with rent balance the issue is the initial rep

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.629 align:start position:0%
balance the issue is the initial rep balance is in the meta sure so say like

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.310 align:start position:0%
balance is in the meta sure so say like this has a starting value of a thousand

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
this has a starting value of a thousand xlm but the issue is every Ledger has a

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.170 align:start position:0%
xlm but the issue is every Ledger has a variable amount that's deducted from

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.569 align:start position:0%
variable amount that's deducted from that thousand xlm and because every

00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:58.430 align:start position:0%
that thousand xlm and because every single Ledger or every single Ledger

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.110 align:start position:0%
single Ledger or every single Ledger entry is subject to this variable rent

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.170 align:start position:0%
entry is subject to this variable rent every single Ledger closed what we'd

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.389 align:start position:0%
every single Ledger closed what we'd have to do is if to contain this

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:07.730 align:start position:0%
have to do is if to contain this information in meta literally submit a

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.910 align:start position:0%
information in meta literally submit a meta entry for every single entry on The

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.370 align:start position:0%
meta entry for every single entry on The Ledger periodically with the updated

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
Ledger periodically with the updated rent information and that's just not

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.690 align:start position:0%
rent information and that's just not possible and so essentially the

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.310 align:start position:0%
possible and so essentially the downstream systems would have to manage

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.230 align:start position:0%
downstream systems would have to manage this rent balance themselves and we

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.329 align:start position:0%
this rent balance themselves and we could probably emit the variable rent

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.490 align:start position:0%
could probably emit the variable rent fee as meta every Ledger close but then

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.569 align:start position:0%
fee as meta every Ledger close but then it would be the responsibility of the

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:27.949 align:start position:0%
it would be the responsibility of the downstream systems to implement

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:30.350 align:start position:0%
downstream systems to implement essentially the rent balance bookkeeping

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:42.889 align:start position:0%
essentially the rent balance bookkeeping themselves if that makes sense

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:46.509 align:start position:0%
foreign

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.230 align:start position:0%
it does sound for the most part like like a win-win so I definitely want to

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.710 align:start position:0%
like a win-win so I definitely want to un probably focus on like what are

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.329 align:start position:0%
un probably focus on like what are the pros

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:57.889 align:start position:0%
the pros of

00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
of of the current Red Diamond system

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.430 align:start position:0%
of the current Red Diamond system compared to exploration Ledger

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.069 align:start position:0%
compared to exploration Ledger yes I think the it comes to to eviction

00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
yes I think the it comes to to eviction pressure and kind of

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
pressure and kind of not being exploitable or being

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.090 align:start position:0%
not being exploitable or being more game proof and so that's the

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.329 align:start position:0%
more game proof and so that's the primary issue with locking in a

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.970 align:start position:0%
primary issue with locking in a essentially a rent fee at creation time

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
essentially a rent fee at creation time is that you open up these

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.449 align:start position:0%
is that you open up these vulnerabilities for the kind of like a

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:23.150 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities for the kind of like a contract storage middleman and for a

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.829 align:start position:0%
contract storage middleman and for a long life spam entries that increase

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:27.170 align:start position:0%
long life spam entries that increase rent fees for everyone else and so those

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.090 align:start position:0%
rent fees for everyone else and so those are the two kind of I think exploits

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.389 align:start position:0%
are the two kind of I think exploits that we want to prevent happening

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
that we want to prevent happening and so if we can find essentially a

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.150 align:start position:0%
and so if we can find essentially a suitable limitations on the

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.069 align:start position:0%
suitable limitations on the expiration Ledger like one limitation

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.230 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger like one limitation being not allowing arbitrarily large

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
being not allowing arbitrarily large lifetimes to defeat those two exploits

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.150 align:start position:0%
lifetimes to defeat those two exploits then I think it would be a good a good

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.009 align:start position:0%
then I think it would be a good a good decision there's also a couple of other

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:50.930 align:start position:0%
decision there's also a couple of other drawbacks I think these are all solvable

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.189 align:start position:0%
drawbacks I think these are all solvable problems but just something to think

00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
problems but just something to think about is that there's certain issues

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.250 align:start position:0%
about is that there's certain issues like because you're locking in an

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.629 align:start position:0%
like because you're locking in an expiration Ledger

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.389 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger there are questions about what to do

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:02.509 align:start position:0%
there are questions about what to do whenever you resize an entry so for

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:04.370 align:start position:0%
whenever you resize an entry so for instance say you create an entry that's

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.290 align:start position:0%
instance say you create an entry that's only one byte large and say okay I want

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.790 align:start position:0%
only one byte large and say okay I want it to have an expiration Ledger 10 years

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.610 align:start position:0%
it to have an expiration Ledger 10 years from now and so you pay the rent fee

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.490 align:start position:0%
from now and so you pay the rent fee for 10 years but for only one byte

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.470 align:start position:0%
for 10 years but for only one byte and then two ledgers later you say oh

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.170 align:start position:0%
and then two ledgers later you say oh this entry is now 100 kilobytes

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
this entry is now 100 kilobytes then you essentially need to

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.470 align:start position:0%
then you essentially need to reconcile okay what do we do in this

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.290 align:start position:0%
reconcile okay what do we do in this situation do we either a shorten the

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.090 align:start position:0%
situation do we either a shorten the lifetime because the rent fee is now

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.189 align:start position:0%
lifetime because the rent fee is now higher because it's you know a larger

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:29.629 align:start position:0%
higher because it's you know a larger entry size

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:31.490 align:start position:0%
entry size just for reference the rent fee is

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.889 align:start position:0%
just for reference the rent fee is charged per byte and so you need to pay

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.629 align:start position:0%
charged per byte and so you need to pay more rent in order to have the same

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:38.090 align:start position:0%
more rent in order to have the same expiration Ledger you did before and so

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.189 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger you did before and so my current thinking for that particular

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:43.370 align:start position:0%
my current thinking for that particular Edge case is that the expiration Ledger

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.610 align:start position:0%
Edge case is that the expiration Ledger should never decrease for instance a

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.610 align:start position:0%
should never decrease for instance a write or an update or changing the size

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.230 align:start position:0%
write or an update or changing the size of an entry should never decrease its

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.569 align:start position:0%
of an entry should never decrease its lifetime it should only match or

00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:55.610 align:start position:0%
lifetime it should only match or increase the lifetime which means that

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.410 align:start position:0%
increase the lifetime which means that if you have an entry that has say 10

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.210 align:start position:0%
if you have an entry that has say 10 years worth of

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.310 align:start position:0%
years worth of or that has an expiration Ledger 10

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.769 align:start position:0%
or that has an expiration Ledger 10 years in the future if you resize that

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:06.410 align:start position:0%
years in the future if you resize that entry then you what you need to do is

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.050 align:start position:0%
entry then you what you need to do is you need to pay for essentially the

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.569 align:start position:0%
you need to pay for essentially the difference so you'd have to pay in this

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:13.250 align:start position:0%
difference so you'd have to pay in this example if you had a one byte entry and

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
example if you had a one byte entry and now it's a you know 10 byte entry you'd

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.509 align:start position:0%
now it's a you know 10 byte entry you'd have to pay for 10 bytes or for the nine

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.370 align:start position:0%
have to pay for 10 bytes or for the nine additional bytes

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.009 align:start position:0%
additional bytes whenever you do that update and so I

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:24.530 align:start position:0%
whenever you do that update and so I think there are like issues like that

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.610 align:start position:0%
think there are like issues like that and then the two exploit

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.829 align:start position:0%
and then the two exploit exploitability cases that rent balance

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:29.810 align:start position:0%
exploitability cases that rent balance solves really elegantly because rent

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.389 align:start position:0%
solves really elegantly because rent balance you you know it's charged

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:34.610 align:start position:0%
balance you you know it's charged every Ledger and so if you resize it

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.590 align:start position:0%
every Ledger and so if you resize it then they'll the you know new

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.030 align:start position:0%
then they'll the you know new additional fees will just be picked up

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.129 align:start position:0%
additional fees will just be picked up on the next Ledger and so it's handled

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:42.050 align:start position:0%
on the next Ledger and so it's handled automatically and then these exploits

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.150 align:start position:0%
automatically and then these exploits are not possible just because

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.710 align:start position:0%
are not possible just because your rent for your paying is always

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.110 align:start position:0%
your rent for your paying is always up to date and so you can never game the

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.790 align:start position:0%
up to date and so you can never game the system by locking in a rent fee early

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.290 align:start position:0%
system by locking in a rent fee early and then using it later when the rent

00:16:51.300 --> 00:17:03.949 align:start position:0%
and then using it later when the rent fee is more expensive

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.329 align:start position:0%
is there anyone on stage or in the audience that want to speak in favor of

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:19.730 align:start position:0%
audience that want to speak in favor of rent balances

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.409 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah I just I just want to comment

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.549 align:start position:0%
so yeah I just I just want to comment on this from a from a product

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:27.470 align:start position:0%
on this from a from a product perspective I definitely think that this

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.890 align:start position:0%
perspective I definitely think that this is this is a big win because the user

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
is this is a big win because the user experience of the previous proposal

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.890 align:start position:0%
experience of the previous proposal red balances is definitely kind of

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.409 align:start position:0%
red balances is definitely kind of like requires a bit of a complex mental

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:41.150 align:start position:0%
like requires a bit of a complex mental model of what rent actually means

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.630 align:start position:0%
model of what rent actually means because when people you know pay rent

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.190 align:start position:0%
because when people you know pay rent they are used to kind of like locking a

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.630 align:start position:0%
they are used to kind of like locking a specific grade for a specific given of

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.370 align:start position:0%
specific grade for a specific given of time a specific given amount of time so

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.710 align:start position:0%
time a specific given amount of time so I do think that this new proposal kind

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.330 align:start position:0%
I do think that this new proposal kind of like sits better with like a mental

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.789 align:start position:0%
of like sits better with like a mental model of of what rent actually is even

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:56.990 align:start position:0%
model of of what rent actually is even though we're not using the word rent

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.850 align:start position:0%
though we're not using the word rent here

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
here

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.150 align:start position:0%
one question that I also asked on Discord

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
Discord is around a the question of

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.390 align:start position:0%
is around a the question of temporary entries and to the question of

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.730 align:start position:0%
temporary entries and to the question of like Auto bumps and what is what are the

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.370 align:start position:0%
like Auto bumps and what is what are the implications for these

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.310 align:start position:0%
implications for these yeah so I think my current thinking is

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.490 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think my current thinking is that we should still have Auto bumps

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.250 align:start position:0%
that we should still have Auto bumps but the auto bump should be optional

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.409 align:start position:0%
but the auto bump should be optional and optional well let me explain what

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:29.630 align:start position:0%
and optional well let me explain what I mean by optional and so I think in

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
I mean by optional and so I think in this system we still want an auto bump

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.409 align:start position:0%
this system we still want an auto bump system such that you know frequently

00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:34.669 align:start position:0%
system such that you know frequently used entries

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
used entries and shared entries such as contract

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.710 align:start position:0%
and shared entries such as contract instances and contract code wasm are

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.630 align:start position:0%
instances and contract code wasm are paid for and so that was envisioning is

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.190 align:start position:0%
paid for and so that was envisioning is that before we were like bumping by some

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.470 align:start position:0%
that before we were like bumping by some you know amount of xlm now because we

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.690 align:start position:0%
you know amount of xlm now because we have this expiration Ledger interface we

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.909 align:start position:0%
have this expiration Ledger interface we would just Bump by some modest amount

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:52.130 align:start position:0%
would just Bump by some modest amount like 10 ledgers per access

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.350 align:start position:0%
like 10 ledgers per access automatically and some of that would

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.390 align:start position:0%
automatically and some of that would look like is that you would pay at the

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.190 align:start position:0%
look like is that you would pay at the current market rate

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.409 align:start position:0%
current market rate whatever the current rent fee is for

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
whatever the current rent fee is for the extension and so even if the entries

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.210 align:start position:0%
the extension and so even if the entries say had like three years worth of rent

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.010 align:start position:0%
say had like three years worth of rent that was paid for two years ago so it

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.750 align:start position:0%
that was paid for two years ago so it was very cheap whenever you access it

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.950 align:start position:0%
was very cheap whenever you access it you would still need to pay for the

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.690 align:start position:0%
you would still need to pay for the additional 10 ledgers at the current

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.010 align:start position:0%
additional 10 ledgers at the current market rate

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.990 align:start position:0%
market rate and so that's for automatic bumps I

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.650 align:start position:0%
and so that's for automatic bumps I think

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.110 align:start position:0%
think what we should do for auto bumps is

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.909 align:start position:0%
what we should do for auto bumps is especially for temporary entries there

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.350 align:start position:0%
especially for temporary entries there were use cases where other bumps are

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.210 align:start position:0%
were use cases where other bumps are useful and use cases where Auto bumps

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.130 align:start position:0%
useful and use cases where Auto bumps are not and so I think when creating an

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.289 align:start position:0%
are not and so I think when creating an entry what you should do is on the

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.970 align:start position:0%
entry what you should do is on the initial item creation you can set a flag

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.789 align:start position:0%
initial item creation you can set a flag and that flag is either Auto bumps true

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:33.830 align:start position:0%
and that flag is either Auto bumps true false and so

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.090 align:start position:0%
false and so what this allows you to do is that

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.169 align:start position:0%
what this allows you to do is that the original developer when you're

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:38.510 align:start position:0%
the original developer when you're creating the entry can choose if this

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.190 align:start position:0%
creating the entry can choose if this entry is something that should be bumped

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
entry is something that should be bumped or something that is like you know

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.810 align:start position:0%
or something that is like you know short-lived so it should expire and then

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.490 align:start position:0%
short-lived so it should expire and then whenever you access that entry that

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.590 align:start position:0%
whenever you access that entry that flag is stored in The Ledger entry and

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.710 align:start position:0%
flag is stored in The Ledger entry and so the Access Auto bump is determined by

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
so the Access Auto bump is determined by that initial create time flag and so I

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.730 align:start position:0%
that initial create time flag and so I think Auto bumps are optional but

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.010 align:start position:0%
think Auto bumps are optional but they're not optional by The Entity

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.049 align:start position:0%
they're not optional by The Entity that's accessing the entry they're

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:02.330 align:start position:0%
that's accessing the entry they're optional based on the entity that's

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.950 align:start position:0%
optional based on the entity that's creating the entry if that makes sense

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.630 align:start position:0%
creating the entry if that makes sense and so I think that makes the most sense

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.310 align:start position:0%
and so I think that makes the most sense now another thing for temporary entries

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.650 align:start position:0%
now another thing for temporary entries is because we now have this expiration

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.750 align:start position:0%
is because we now have this expiration Ledger I know before we kind of went

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.490 align:start position:0%
Ledger I know before we kind of went back and forth as to you know if we

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.169 align:start position:0%
back and forth as to you know if we should have expert or temporary entries

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
should have expert or temporary entries with like firm or exact

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.529 align:start position:0%
with like firm or exact cut-offs or not or like that expire

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:23.930 align:start position:0%
cut-offs or not or like that expire on the exact Ledger entries and so I

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.390 align:start position:0%
on the exact Ledger entries and so I think under this system

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.130 align:start position:0%
think under this system now that we don't use rent balances

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.529 align:start position:0%
now that we don't use rent balances that should be very possible and easy to

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
that should be very possible and easy to do such that you can now use temporary

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.150 align:start position:0%
do such that you can now use temporary entries for security features such that

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
entries for security features such that if you want an entry that lasts exactly

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
if you want an entry that lasts exactly 100 ledgers what you would do is just

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.650 align:start position:0%
100 ledgers what you would do is just say make a temporary entry set the

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.870 align:start position:0%
say make a temporary entry set the expiration ledger to you know or set

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.110 align:start position:0%
expiration ledger to you know or set the TTL to 100 and then set auto bump to

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.909 align:start position:0%
the TTL to 100 and then set auto bump to false

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:52.850 align:start position:0%
false now I think

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.890 align:start position:0%
now I think we still need to actually I still

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.789 align:start position:0%
we still need to actually I still need to think about that a little bit

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:58.190 align:start position:0%
need to think about that a little bit more as to if we can because right

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.470 align:start position:0%
more as to if we can because right now we are allowing both temporary and

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.330 align:start position:0%
now we are allowing both temporary and restorable entries to be bumped by

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.490 align:start position:0%
restorable entries to be bumped by anyone anytime and so I take back that

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.049 align:start position:0%
anyone anytime and so I take back that said they still might not be appropriate

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:08.690 align:start position:0%
said they still might not be appropriate for security uses out of the box

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
for security uses out of the box but so what I'm kind of envisioning

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
but so what I'm kind of envisioning right now is the autobump flag and then

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.810 align:start position:0%
right now is the autobump flag and then in addition to the automatic bumps on

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.370 align:start position:0%
in addition to the automatic bumps on access which both temporary and

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.690 align:start position:0%
access which both temporary and restorable entries

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.270 align:start position:0%
restorable entries have you can also still manually

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.549 align:start position:0%
have you can also still manually bump any entry both temporary and

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:23.570 align:start position:0%
bump any entry both temporary and restorable

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.610 align:start position:0%
restorable via an operation and that operation

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.350 align:start position:0%
via an operation and that operation is similar to what was in rent balance

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.230 align:start position:0%
is similar to what was in rent balance but now you just specify the new

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.049 align:start position:0%
but now you just specify the new expiration Ledger and then my thinking

00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:34.669 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger and then my thinking is that whenever you bump or whenever

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:38.510 align:start position:0%
is that whenever you bump or whenever you pay for more you can either

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.890 align:start position:0%
you pay for more you can either there's two options here sorry

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
October were you saying something no sorry

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
no sorry oh so I think there's whenever you

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.789 align:start position:0%
oh so I think there's whenever you do a manual bump operation to extend the

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
do a manual bump operation to extend the expiration Ledger there are two ways we

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.870 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger there are two ways we could think about it first you could

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.450 align:start position:0%
could think about it first you could either be credited for the amount you've

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.310 align:start position:0%
either be credited for the amount you've already paid and then view it as an

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.190 align:start position:0%
already paid and then view it as an extension so for instance say

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.370 align:start position:0%
extension so for instance say you know I have a ledger that's set

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.770 align:start position:0%
you know I have a ledger that's set to expire in a year and I want to expire

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
to expire in a year and I want to expire it to expire in 18 months one potential

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.250 align:start position:0%
it to expire in 18 months one potential solution would be the rent bump

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.649 align:start position:0%
solution would be the rent bump operation only charges you at the

00:22:18.659 --> 00:22:20.570 align:start position:0%
operation only charges you at the current market rate for six more months

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.149 align:start position:0%
current market rate for six more months of rent it says hey there's already you

00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:25.669 align:start position:0%
of rent it says hey there's already you know 12 months of rent here so we're

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:26.450 align:start position:0%
know 12 months of rent here so we're only going to charge you for the

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.010 align:start position:0%
only going to charge you for the additional six so the total comes out to

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.830 align:start position:0%
additional six so the total comes out to 18 months that's option one now the

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.930 align:start position:0%
18 months that's option one now the drawback to that option is again for

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.850 align:start position:0%
drawback to that option is again for that first 12 months you're locking in a

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.110 align:start position:0%
that first 12 months you're locking in a lower rate

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.789 align:start position:0%
lower rate in that last six months is now at the

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
in that last six months is now at the market rate so that's option one option

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.470 align:start position:0%
market rate so that's option one option two is that whenever you do a manual

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
two is that whenever you do a manual bump you don't count the previous

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.490 align:start position:0%
bump you don't count the previous balance and the previous balance is

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.630 align:start position:0%
balance and the previous balance is burned

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.730 align:start position:0%
burned what this would be is that if you

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.649 align:start position:0%
what this would be is that if you know there's an entry that you want to

00:22:51.659 --> 00:22:53.870 align:start position:0%
know there's an entry that you want to live 18 months but it currently lives it

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.549 align:start position:0%
live 18 months but it currently lives it currently has an expiration that's only

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
currently has an expiration that's only 12 months in the future you have to pay

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
12 months in the future you have to pay 18 months of rent at the current market

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.049 align:start position:0%
18 months of rent at the current market price and then the expiration Ledger is

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:05.570 align:start position:0%
price and then the expiration Ledger is reset and that in this way essentially

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.250 align:start position:0%
reset and that in this way essentially the 12 months that it was already there

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.409 align:start position:0%
the 12 months that it was already there is burned and you're charged for the

00:23:09.419 --> 00:23:11.270 align:start position:0%
is burned and you're charged for the entire 18 months of the market rate

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.130 align:start position:0%
entire 18 months of the market rate now the advantage to this

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.010 align:start position:0%
now the advantage to this is again I think for a Network Health

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
is again I think for a Network Health perspective and to prevent capability we

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.330 align:start position:0%
perspective and to prevent capability we want to be charging as close to Market

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.669 align:start position:0%
want to be charging as close to Market rates whenever we can and so in this

00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:25.490 align:start position:0%
rates whenever we can and so in this system you always can be charging you

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
system you always can be charging you know the market rate however it's kind

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
know the market rate however it's kind of a poor ux because you're burning this

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.549 align:start position:0%
of a poor ux because you're burning this amount

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:33.230 align:start position:0%
amount it seems that like in something like

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.250 align:start position:0%
it seems that like in something like this should be probably strictly

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.010 align:start position:0%
this should be probably strictly additive and so I guess as far as the

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.289 align:start position:0%
additive and so I guess as far as the the two interfaces are concerned what

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:41.090 align:start position:0%
the two interfaces are concerned what are your thoughts as two manual rent

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.210 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts as two manual rent bumps

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.169 align:start position:0%
that was a lot I just want to go back to a point you made earlier quickly

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:53.450 align:start position:0%
to a point you made earlier quickly about temporary entries so if I

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.070 align:start position:0%
about temporary entries so if I understand correctly you are suggesting

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.350 align:start position:0%
understand correctly you are suggesting that the temporary entries if we do go

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.690 align:start position:0%
that the temporary entries if we do go for Ledger expert for expiration

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
for Ledger expert for expiration Ledger the the

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
Ledger the the the contract should be the same that

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.789 align:start position:0%
the contract should be the same that is we're kind of like letting go of the

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:08.450 align:start position:0%
is we're kind of like letting go of the whole

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.710 align:start position:0%
whole short medium long terms and making it

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.990 align:start position:0%
short medium long terms and making it the exact same interface as restorable

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.850 align:start position:0%
the exact same interface as restorable Ledger entries

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.310 align:start position:0%
Ledger entries yeah I think so now the one thing though

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so now the one thing though is I initially said they were fit for

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.270 align:start position:0%
is I initially said they were fit for security uses but then I caught myself

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.149 align:start position:0%
security uses but then I caught myself because right now any user can bump any

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:29.690 align:start position:0%
because right now any user can bump any entry which means that even if you

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.430 align:start position:0%
entry which means that even if you have say like a kyc entry that's only

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.710 align:start position:0%
have say like a kyc entry that's only supposed to last 128 ledgers and you

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.890 align:start position:0%
supposed to last 128 ledgers and you initially set its expiration alleged

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.930 align:start position:0%
initially set its expiration alleged to be 128 ledgers in the future a

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.330 align:start position:0%
to be 128 ledgers in the future a malicious user could bump that using the

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.370 align:start position:0%
malicious user could bump that using the manual operation and so I think for

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.350 align:start position:0%
manual operation and so I think for security purposes

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.570 align:start position:0%
security purposes we still need to that still needs to

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.070 align:start position:0%
we still need to that still needs to be enforced at the contract level

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.049 align:start position:0%
be enforced at the contract level whereas like in this case the contract

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:53.210 align:start position:0%
whereas like in this case the contract would need to embed their own like TTL

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.190 align:start position:0%
would need to embed their own like TTL inside the temporary entry

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
inside the temporary entry just because you have this arbitrary

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.390 align:start position:0%
just because you have this arbitrary bump I mean I guess we could

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
bump I mean I guess we could have a flag that's like no bump to

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.409 align:start position:0%
have a flag that's like no bump to Temporary entries

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:04.909 align:start position:0%
Temporary entries but that might be adding too many

00:25:04.919 --> 00:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
but that might be adding too many flags at this point because the

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.330 align:start position:0%
flags at this point because the current interfaces anyone can bump

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.649 align:start position:0%
current interfaces anyone can bump anything

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.870 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for answering that question going back to Auto bumps for a

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.970 align:start position:0%
question going back to Auto bumps for a second I do think you know I've been

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.130 align:start position:0%
second I do think you know I've been thinking about the the wallet and dap

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.870 align:start position:0%
thinking about the the wallet and dap experience

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.970 align:start position:0%
experience and what they need to think about in

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.769 align:start position:0%
and what they need to think about in terms of State expiration

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:30.529 align:start position:0%
terms of State expiration and it does seem like autobump doesn't

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:34.190 align:start position:0%
and it does seem like autobump doesn't negate the need for wallets and dapps to

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.850 align:start position:0%
negate the need for wallets and dapps to actually be attentive to The Ledger

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.390 align:start position:0%
actually be attentive to The Ledger expiration times and to and to act on

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.669 align:start position:0%
expiration times and to and to act on that either

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:45.590 align:start position:0%
that either either by like suggesting the user to

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.409 align:start position:0%
either by like suggesting the user to do like a manual bump or to initiate a

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:53.029 align:start position:0%
do like a manual bump or to initiate a manual bump so it it does seem like Auto

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.590 align:start position:0%
manual bump so it it does seem like Auto bump

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.370 align:start position:0%
bump

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.870 align:start position:0%
has this like implicit Behavior to it in which we're like extending Ledger

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
which we're like extending Ledger entry expression times but it doesn't

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:03.890 align:start position:0%
entry expression times but it doesn't actually

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.169 align:start position:0%
actually it like adds complexity to the system

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:08.210 align:start position:0%
it like adds complexity to the system but it doesn't actually remove

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.570 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't actually remove complexity from the implementation of

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.549 align:start position:0%
complexity from the implementation of of like products it makes things a bit

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:14.529 align:start position:0%
of like products it makes things a bit less

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.909 align:start position:0%
less expected and predictable

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:18.710 align:start position:0%
expected and predictable so I think

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.190 align:start position:0%
so I think yeah go ahead well I think the the

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.409 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead well I think the the auto bumps serve a very specific purpose

00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:25.970 align:start position:0%
auto bumps serve a very specific purpose or at least they were initially designed

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.250 align:start position:0%
or at least they were initially designed to serve a specific purpose and this is

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.350 align:start position:0%
to serve a specific purpose and this is the shared state so from your example

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.510 align:start position:0%
the shared state so from your example like like a Dap or like a wallet

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.590 align:start position:0%
like like a Dap or like a wallet right

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
right this is not a good example for

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.210 align:start position:0%
this is not a good example for auto bumps because you have a particular

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.190 align:start position:0%
auto bumps because you have a particular balance entry that you care about and no

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.169 align:start position:0%
balance entry that you care about and no one else really cares about and so for a

00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:43.789 align:start position:0%
one else really cares about and so for a wallet perspective

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:45.289 align:start position:0%
wallet perspective say you want your wallet to live for

00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:47.750 align:start position:0%
say you want your wallet to live for one year the correct answer is not just

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.210 align:start position:0%
one year the correct answer is not just to keep you balancing it with via Smart

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.950 align:start position:0%
to keep you balancing it with via Smart contract so you Auto bump it or rather

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.289 align:start position:0%
contract so you Auto bump it or rather just to do a manual operation and then

00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:57.289 align:start position:0%
just to do a manual operation and then to bump that by a year the use case for

00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:59.810 align:start position:0%
to bump that by a year the use case for autobums is more for contract instances

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.230 align:start position:0%
autobums is more for contract instances and contract wasm particularly wasm is a

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.269 align:start position:0%
and contract wasm particularly wasm is a difficult one because you can have a

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:07.310 align:start position:0%
difficult one because you can have a single wazzin blob that many different

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.710 align:start position:0%
single wazzin blob that many different contract instances use and the question

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.890 align:start position:0%
contract instances use and the question is who pays for that was and blob and so

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
is who pays for that was and blob and so essentially by having like this Auto

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.330 align:start position:0%
essentially by having like this Auto bump feature that every user who touches

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.669 align:start position:0%
bump feature that every user who touches it is required to pay a little bit

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:22.490 align:start position:0%
it is required to pay a little bit and you can essentially like share the

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.250 align:start position:0%
and you can essentially like share the cost of you know this contract and this

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.690 align:start position:0%
cost of you know this contract and this contract instance or this contract code

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.789 align:start position:0%
contract instance or this contract code in this contract instance among all the

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:31.010 align:start position:0%
in this contract instance among all the users who are using it and so I think

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.110 align:start position:0%
users who are using it and so I think the other bump feature was specifically

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.390 align:start position:0%
the other bump feature was specifically for these kind of shared resources

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.789 align:start position:0%
for these kind of shared resources that there is no clear owner

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:40.130 align:start position:0%
that there is no clear owner for instance like usdc it'd be kind

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.350 align:start position:0%
for instance like usdc it'd be kind of a crappy interface if you know 10 000

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.789 align:start position:0%
of a crappy interface if you know 10 000 people used it a day but there was no

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:46.070 align:start position:0%
people used it a day but there was no Auto bump and then the 10 000 in first

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.350 align:start position:0%
Auto bump and then the 10 000 in first person had to go pay rent because it got

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.730 align:start position:0%
person had to go pay rent because it got archived or something and he was just

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.590 align:start position:0%
archived or something and he was just the or they were just the The Unlucky

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.930 align:start position:0%
the or they were just the The Unlucky user that drawed the Short Straw and so

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.310 align:start position:0%
user that drawed the Short Straw and so I think there definitely still is a

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.690 align:start position:0%
I think there definitely still is a pretty strong use case for auto bumps

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.850 align:start position:0%
pretty strong use case for auto bumps for these sort of different entry types

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.289 align:start position:0%
for these sort of different entry types but I agree for something like a

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:02.450 align:start position:0%
but I agree for something like a adapter a wallet you would still need

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.130 align:start position:0%
adapter a wallet you would still need you know this manual operation in

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.390 align:start position:0%
you know this manual operation in addition to audit bumps

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.909 align:start position:0%
oh would you recommend a ledger entry that

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:17.870 align:start position:0%
would you recommend a ledger entry that is a user specific like a balance or an

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.310 align:start position:0%
is a user specific like a balance or an LP position

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.610 align:start position:0%
LP position to be Auto bumpable or not Auto bumpable

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.169 align:start position:0%
I mean I think it just depends on the contract

00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
I think it just depends on the contract implementation I don't think it needs to

00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:33.769 align:start position:0%
implementation I don't think it needs to be Auto bumpable the same way that

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:35.810 align:start position:0%
be Auto bumpable the same way that contract instances and stuff do

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
contract instances and stuff do but I don't see like a downside I think

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.570 align:start position:0%
but I don't see like a downside I think the general thinking is

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.850 align:start position:0%
the general thinking is the the kind of design model I had in

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.769 align:start position:0%
the the kind of design model I had in my head is that extending a lifetime

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:48.289 align:start position:0%
my head is that extending a lifetime should never be negative

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
should never be negative that like this is why it's not good

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.430 align:start position:0%
that like this is why it's not good for security cases because anyone can

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.769 align:start position:0%
for security cases because anyone can extend any lifetime such that it should

00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
extend any lifetime such that it should always be a positive action it cannot

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.250 align:start position:0%
always be a positive action it cannot be a negative action

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.810 align:start position:0%
be a negative action and so I think

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
and so I think you know I think there was talks last

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.769 align:start position:0%
you know I think there was talks last time of exposing an Autobahn flag and

00:29:03.779 --> 00:29:04.909 align:start position:0%
time of exposing an Autobahn flag and I think this probably makes the most

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:07.070 align:start position:0%
I think this probably makes the most sense that you know contract instances

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.049 align:start position:0%
sense that you know contract instances and contract wise in code

00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:10.190 align:start position:0%
and contract wise in code you don't have this option whenever

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.289 align:start position:0%
you don't have this option whenever you deploy it it has it must be Auto

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:14.450 align:start position:0%
you deploy it it has it must be Auto bumped but then for any other key you

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.830 align:start position:0%
bumped but then for any other key you create I think you probably just give

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.590 align:start position:0%
create I think you probably just give the option too or or should we just

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.409 align:start position:0%
the option too or or should we just because there's also like I mean you

00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:22.549 align:start position:0%
because there's also like I mean you could also say that the contract

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:24.049 align:start position:0%
could also say that the contract instances and contract code are Auto

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:26.210 align:start position:0%
instances and contract code are Auto bumped and nothing else is but then you

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.889 align:start position:0%
bumped and nothing else is but then you can kind of get into this sticky

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:30.049 align:start position:0%
can kind of get into this sticky situation where there are still contract

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:32.029 align:start position:0%
situation where there are still contract types that have shared States so for

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:34.250 align:start position:0%
types that have shared States so for instance if you can think like a a

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.470 align:start position:0%
instance if you can think like a a like a DEX right and there's like

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.210 align:start position:0%
like a DEX right and there's like this asset pair that start as an

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.010 align:start position:0%
this asset pair that start as an entry and many different people are like

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.289 align:start position:0%
entry and many different people are like viewing or trading that asset pair you

00:29:42.299 --> 00:29:44.269 align:start position:0%
viewing or trading that asset pair you wouldn't want one individual to be stuck

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:46.970 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want one individual to be stuck with the bill and so I think that there

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.490 align:start position:0%
with the bill and so I think that there are still I still think Auto bump is a

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
are still I still think Auto bump is a powerful primitive and I think it should

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.850 align:start position:0%
powerful primitive and I think it should probably be enabled by default just

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.950 align:start position:0%
probably be enabled by default just because it's the safest route

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
because it's the safest route but I think you know having a

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.029 align:start position:0%
but I think you know having a option to turn it off especially for

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.470 align:start position:0%
option to turn it off especially for personal State like balances is probably

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.269 align:start position:0%
personal State like balances is probably a good idea and so now that I've

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:03.049 align:start position:0%
a good idea and so now that I've talked for a little bit I think the

00:30:03.059 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
talked for a little bit I think the answer your question I would probably

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.529 align:start position:0%
answer your question I would probably say for something like a token balance I

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:08.149 align:start position:0%
say for something like a token balance I would probably say no to the auto bump

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.710 align:start position:0%
would probably say no to the auto bump Behavior just because it's something

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.210 align:start position:0%
Behavior just because it's something that will probably like the lifetime of

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.950 align:start position:0%
that will probably like the lifetime of which will be explicitly managed by a

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:25.870 align:start position:0%
which will be explicitly managed by a wallet

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:31.130 align:start position:0%
because I I agree it's kind of needed the one thing that maybe like I'm

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.990 align:start position:0%
the one thing that maybe like I'm thinking about there is that

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.350 align:start position:0%
thinking about there is that so for the first version we can do you

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.090 align:start position:0%
so for the first version we can do you know something like that right like I

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.649 align:start position:0%
know something like that right like I would imagine that maybe

00:30:39.659 --> 00:30:42.049 align:start position:0%
would imagine that maybe in the future we would want to have like

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:43.130 align:start position:0%
in the future we would want to have like

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
maybe something that that kind of Auto Tunes over time

00:30:47.399 --> 00:30:50.389 align:start position:0%
that kind of Auto Tunes over time because like in the example of like the

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:51.169 align:start position:0%
because like in the example of like the

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.090 align:start position:0%
you have like a very you know active contract the wazam is basically going to

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.549 align:start position:0%
contract the wazam is basically going to be used multiple times per Ledger

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:01.370 align:start position:0%
be used multiple times per Ledger and you end up with really reaching your

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.250 align:start position:0%
and you end up with really reaching your limit fairly quickly and then when

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.870 align:start position:0%
limit fairly quickly and then when the limit is reach you actually are

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.630 align:start position:0%
the limit is reach you actually are backed into that situation where

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.669 align:start position:0%
backed into that situation where you know some users are going to bump

00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:13.029 align:start position:0%
you know some users are going to bump some are not going to bump

00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:15.830 align:start position:0%
some are not going to bump like basically the first one in The

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.930 align:start position:0%
like basically the first one in The Ledger all right and the bumping

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.430 align:start position:0%
Ledger all right and the bumping and then

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.389 align:start position:0%
and then

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:29.630 align:start position:0%
yeah and that and also like the if the what if the blob is is fairly large

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:35.090 align:start position:0%
maybe that auto bump on the ends up adding quite a bit of cost to each

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.830 align:start position:0%
adding quite a bit of cost to each individual transaction

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.710 align:start position:0%
individual transaction if it's you know bumping like for a good

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.090 align:start position:0%
if it's you know bumping like for a good number of Legends let's say you know 100

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.490 align:start position:0%
number of Legends let's say you know 100 ledgers or something

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.610 align:start position:0%
ledgers or something to keep in mind

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.610 align:start position:0%
Garen there is a question about the mechanics of Autobahn from Paul can you

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.889 align:start position:0%
mechanics of Autobahn from Paul can you expand a bit on when does Auto bump

00:31:54.899 --> 00:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
expand a bit on when does Auto bump actually occur

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.690 align:start position:0%
actually occur yeah so the current strategy is that

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.570 align:start position:0%
yeah so the current strategy is that autobump occurs on all access which is

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.549 align:start position:0%
autobump occurs on all access which is both read and write access

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:08.090 align:start position:0%
both read and write access how this works under the hood is that

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.769 align:start position:0%
how this works under the hood is that you know in addition to having the

00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:11.870 align:start position:0%
you know in addition to having the expiration Ledger stored in The Ledger

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.450 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger stored in The Ledger entry we also have like this kind of

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.130 align:start position:0%
entry we also have like this kind of shell entry type

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
shell entry type that is used for read-only Access so

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.930 align:start position:0%
that is used for read-only Access so for instance like for your wasin blob

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.230 align:start position:0%
for instance like for your wasin blob they're only access read only and

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.690 align:start position:0%
they're only access read only and essentially to modify a ledger entry in

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.950 align:start position:0%
essentially to modify a ledger entry in The Bucket List you have to rewrite the

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.049 align:start position:0%
The Bucket List you have to rewrite the entire entry at the top level bucket

00:32:30.059 --> 00:32:33.470 align:start position:0%
entire entry at the top level bucket and so if we were to modify the you

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.450 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to modify the you know the entry or the the expiration

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
know the entry or the the expiration Ledger directly in The Ledger entry

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.350 align:start position:0%
Ledger directly in The Ledger entry you'd have to rewrite the entire wasin

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.289 align:start position:0%
you'd have to rewrite the entire wasin blob and So to avoid this we have like

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
blob and So to avoid this we have like this kind of shim entry type which is

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.049 align:start position:0%
this kind of shim entry type which is just an expiration Ledger extension and

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:49.850 align:start position:0%
just an expiration Ledger extension and so this entry is very small it's

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
so this entry is very small it's literally just a key and then the new

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.289 align:start position:0%
literally just a key and then the new expiration Ledger and so we use this

00:32:54.299 --> 00:32:55.850 align:start position:0%
expiration Ledger and so we use this entry type

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.250 align:start position:0%
entry type whenever we want to bump a read-only

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.669 align:start position:0%
whenever we want to bump a read-only entry and so in the wasm use case even

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:04.130 align:start position:0%
entry and so in the wasm use case even though you're only reading the wasm

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.049 align:start position:0%
though you're only reading the wasm because we are Auto bumping you do

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:08.029 align:start position:0%
because we are Auto bumping you do have to do a small write but that right

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:09.950 align:start position:0%
have to do a small write but that right is very small it's the minimal size

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.230 align:start position:0%
is very small it's the minimal size right you can do and so we are

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.090 align:start position:0%
right you can do and so we are implicitly turning every read into a

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.350 align:start position:0%
implicitly turning every read into a read write

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.789 align:start position:0%
read write but we're not rewriting the entire

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:18.889 align:start position:0%
but we're not rewriting the entire entry we're reading the entire entry and

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
entry we're reading the entire entry and then writing a very small entry with the

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.870 align:start position:0%
then writing a very small entry with the new expiration Ledger and so under the

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
new expiration Ledger and so under the hood that's how we implement it

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.690 align:start position:0%
hood that's how we implement it efficiently

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:40.850 align:start position:0%
efficiently rent bumps for both reads and writes

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:44.870 align:start position:0%
so I do want to touch on something that you

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.190 align:start position:0%
I do want to touch on something that you mentioned before which is the question

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.509 align:start position:0%
mentioned before which is the question of with should bumping

00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:53.029 align:start position:0%
of with should bumping like pumping in general should that

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:56.810 align:start position:0%
like pumping in general should that be a flag it does feel like you know

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.850 align:start position:0%
be a flag it does feel like you know last week we talked a bit about

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.310 align:start position:0%
last week we talked a bit about you know very various Oracle usage

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.130 align:start position:0%
you know very various Oracle usage patterns and you know we got to

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.529 align:start position:0%
patterns and you know we got to inclusion where sometimes the contract

00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:10.669 align:start position:0%
inclusion where sometimes the contract developer would want to limit or give an

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.829 align:start position:0%
developer would want to limit or give an upper boundary to when a ledger entry

00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
upper boundary to when a ledger entry should exist

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
should exist and

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.129 align:start position:0%
and making it non-bumpable is a very kind of

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.750 align:start position:0%
making it non-bumpable is a very kind of like easy way to do that

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.510 align:start position:0%
like easy way to do that the question is like does that

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.930 align:start position:0%
the question is like does that over complex the system

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.149 align:start position:0%
over complex the system well so I guess we have we have two

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.369 align:start position:0%
well so I guess we have we have two different questions here

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:33.169 align:start position:0%
different questions here I think we have the question of do we

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
I think we have the question of do we want to

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
want to does the entry

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.089 align:start position:0%
does the entry Auto bump and then does the entry

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:40.129 align:start position:0%
Auto bump and then does the entry allow bumps

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.849 align:start position:0%
allow bumps and so I think from an implementation

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:45.829 align:start position:0%
and so I think from an implementation standpoint these would be very easy to

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:46.730 align:start position:0%
standpoint these would be very easy to implement

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
implement we could just you know thrown a Flags

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.849 align:start position:0%
we could just you know thrown a Flags field on The Ledger entry

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:51.950 align:start position:0%
field on The Ledger entry and Define a couple of flags I think

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.629 align:start position:0%
and Define a couple of flags I think the question is

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.210 align:start position:0%
the question is is this you know making the user

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.710 align:start position:0%
is this you know making the user experience too complex

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.290 align:start position:0%
experience too complex and so what this would look like is I

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.250 align:start position:0%
and so what this would look like is I think

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:01.849 align:start position:0%
think

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.609 align:start position:0%
this would only be explicable to Temporary entries I think

00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:08.870 align:start position:0%
Temporary entries I think or Okay so let's talk about the

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.329 align:start position:0%
or Okay so let's talk about the Autobahn flag first I think the Autobahn

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
Autobahn flag first I think the Autobahn flag

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.810 align:start position:0%
flag whether or not this item is auto

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.270 align:start position:0%
whether or not this item is auto bumped on access it could be an optional

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.829 align:start position:0%
bumped on access it could be an optional flag for both temporary and restorable

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:20.569 align:start position:0%
flag for both temporary and restorable entries but I think it should be

00:35:20.579 --> 00:35:22.910 align:start position:0%
entries but I think it should be strictly enforced for contract wasm and

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.270 align:start position:0%
strictly enforced for contract wasm and contract instances now for the should

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.370 align:start position:0%
contract instances now for the should you allow bumps at all I think we could

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
you allow bumps at all I think we could allow that flag but that flag could only

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.270 align:start position:0%
allow that flag but that flag could only be used for temporary entries

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.470 align:start position:0%
be used for temporary entries and so this would be the use case

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.609 align:start position:0%
and so this would be the use case where you either have like a security

00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:36.170 align:start position:0%
where you either have like a security use case

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.430 align:start position:0%
use case where you want this to do exactly

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.410 align:start position:0%
where you want this to do exactly some number of ledgers or the Oracle use

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.849 align:start position:0%
some number of ledgers or the Oracle use case where the thing is only valid for

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:43.250 align:start position:0%
case where the thing is only valid for five minutes or whatever and then if you

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.829 align:start position:0%
five minutes or whatever and then if you set this flag then this entry would not

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:48.650 align:start position:0%
set this flag then this entry would not receive Auto bumps and it would also not

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
receive Auto bumps and it would also not be bumpable by the manual operation and

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
be bumpable by the manual operation and if you tried to bump it it would just

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.410 align:start position:0%
if you tried to bump it it would just fail or Panic or something like that now

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.790 align:start position:0%
fail or Panic or something like that now you would only want this black on

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.829 align:start position:0%
you would only want this black on temporary entries because restorable

00:35:57.839 --> 00:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
temporary entries because restorable entries and unique entries should always

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.010 align:start position:0%
entries and unique entries should always be bumpable

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.690 align:start position:0%
be bumpable they they don't necessarily need to

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.670 align:start position:0%
they they don't necessarily need to always have Auto bombs but they should

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.250 align:start position:0%
always have Auto bombs but they should always be bumpable just because they are

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.930 align:start position:0%
always be bumpable just because they are important information that needs to be

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.569 align:start position:0%
important information that needs to be saved which is why they are subject to

00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
saved which is why they are subject to being sent to the state expiration node

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.670 align:start position:0%
being sent to the state expiration node when they expired and so just because

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.650 align:start position:0%
when they expired and so just because the design parameter for this entry

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.210 align:start position:0%
the design parameter for this entry is that it's supposed to be important

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.650 align:start position:0%
is that it's supposed to be important live State

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.150 align:start position:0%
live State there should be no use cases where

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.770 align:start position:0%
there should be no use cases where you wouldn't want to bump or wouldn't

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.569 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to bump or wouldn't want to allow a unique or restorable

00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:28.970 align:start position:0%
want to allow a unique or restorable entry to be bumpable and so I think that

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.310 align:start position:0%
entry to be bumpable and so I think that is the the most technically complete

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.410 align:start position:0%
is the the most technically complete kind of interface

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.150 align:start position:0%
kind of interface it's very you know feasible from a

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.130 align:start position:0%
it's very you know feasible from a core perspective the only question is if

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.510 align:start position:0%
core perspective the only question is if that's too much complexity at the end

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.329 align:start position:0%
that's too much complexity at the end user

00:36:41.339 --> 00:36:43.930 align:start position:0%
foreign

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.270 align:start position:0%
I think that as you described this If it creates more Divergence between

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.190 align:start position:0%
If it creates more Divergence between temporary entries and restorable entries

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.770 align:start position:0%
temporary entries and restorable entries then

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.050 align:start position:0%
then probably for the sake of Simplicity I

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
probably for the sake of Simplicity I say we shouldn't include it especially

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.870 align:start position:0%
say we shouldn't include it especially because this is something that the

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
because this is something that the contract developer can program for in

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:05.270 align:start position:0%
contract developer can program for in their contract

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
their contract I will say if we if we go this route and

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.190 align:start position:0%
I will say if we if we go this route and say if we I think so so if I'm

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.450 align:start position:0%
say if we I think so so if I'm understanding it correctly we don't want

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.910 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly we don't want Divergence and so we'd have an autobump

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.170 align:start position:0%
Divergence and so we'd have an autobump flag

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.150 align:start position:0%
flag true false but we would not have the

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.490 align:start position:0%
true false but we would not have the no bump flag I think if we go this route

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.130 align:start position:0%
no bump flag I think if we go this route we need to be very clear in our

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.650 align:start position:0%
we need to be very clear in our documentation that the expiration Ledger

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.390 align:start position:0%
documentation that the expiration Ledger is not absolute

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.710 align:start position:0%
is not absolute because if you know have like a

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.150 align:start position:0%
because if you know have like a temporary entry self-delink entry and

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.290 align:start position:0%
temporary entry self-delink entry and then there's a field called expiration

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
then there's a field called expiration Ledger it's a reasonable assumption that

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.829 align:start position:0%
Ledger it's a reasonable assumption that The Ledger would be deleted immediately

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
The Ledger would be deleted immediately after that ledger and if we don't have

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.970 align:start position:0%
after that ledger and if we don't have this no bump flag that's not the case

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.190 align:start position:0%
this no bump flag that's not the case because a malicious user could you know

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.810 align:start position:0%
because a malicious user could you know invoke the operation and bump any

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.670 align:start position:0%
invoke the operation and bump any temporary entry even if autobump is

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.010 align:start position:0%
temporary entry even if autobump is disabled and so you know I think

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.630 align:start position:0%
disabled and so you know I think that's a fine interface decision to make

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.670 align:start position:0%
that's a fine interface decision to make that all entries are bumpable but I

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.770 align:start position:0%
that all entries are bumpable but I think we need to make that very clear

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.810 align:start position:0%
think we need to make that very clear just from a ux perspective so that we

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.010 align:start position:0%
just from a ux perspective so that we don't have security issues with

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.690 align:start position:0%
don't have security issues with temporary entries being used improperly

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on this what do people think about

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
what do people think about should we have the bump bumpable flag

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.089 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to type a big thing but I could actually say it

00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:24.890 align:start position:0%
could actually say it I think I would vote for having

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
I think I would vote for having not having an Autobahn flag

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:30.050 align:start position:0%
not having an Autobahn flag if possible just having a fewer

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.370 align:start position:0%
if possible just having a fewer configuration options for the different

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.390 align:start position:0%
configuration options for the different types of storage like there's two

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.530 align:start position:0%
types of storage like there's two different types of storage and they act

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.670 align:start position:0%
different types of storage and they act differently I think that's fine to

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.410 align:start position:0%
differently I think that's fine to explain and understand

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
explain and understand but if you have to say okay there's

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.250 align:start position:0%
but if you have to say okay there's restorable entries and there's temporary

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.510 align:start position:0%
restorable entries and there's temporary entries and they act in this way unless

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.550 align:start position:0%
entries and they act in this way unless you enable auto bump on them and then

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.990 align:start position:0%
you enable auto bump on them and then restore volunteers like you know what I

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.950 align:start position:0%
restore volunteers like you know what I mean there's like four different

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.390 align:start position:0%
mean there's like four different configurations Now versus just two

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.190 align:start position:0%
configurations Now versus just two so Paul are you talking about the

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.410 align:start position:0%
so Paul are you talking about the bumpable flag or the auto bumpable flag

00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:01.609 align:start position:0%
bumpable flag or the auto bumpable flag sorry yes sorry pumpable okay

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.290 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that makes sense to me it's just not everything is bumped

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.050 align:start position:0%
just not everything is bumped but just so I understand are we still

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
but just so I understand are we still interested in the Autobahn flag or do

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.470 align:start position:0%
interested in the Autobahn flag or do we also want to Nick say that and just

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.670 align:start position:0%
we also want to Nick say that and just say everything I bumps as well

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.190 align:start position:0%
I definitely don't think that everything should be Auto bumpable by default

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.530 align:start position:0%
should be Auto bumpable by default

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:28.490 align:start position:0%
yeah it does sound like for from a completeness perspective having both of

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.490 align:start position:0%
completeness perspective having both of these flags kind of like covers

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.410 align:start position:0%
these flags kind of like covers

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:38.569 align:start position:0%
most use cases

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.370 align:start position:0%
I mean one thing we can do is just like if we don't want to expose the

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.710 align:start position:0%
just like if we don't want to expose the bumpable flag now we can just Define it

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.990 align:start position:0%
bumpable flag now we can just Define it in the xdr and defined in core just not

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.270 align:start position:0%
in the xdr and defined in core just not exposing the SDK

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.250 align:start position:0%
exposing the SDK and then turn that on V2 if we want

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
and then turn that on V2 if we want to you know have a more complicated ux

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.370 align:start position:0%
to you know have a more complicated ux Matrix for storage

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
Matrix for storage that would at least give us future

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.089 align:start position:0%
that would at least give us future proofing or like I think actually if we

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:02.870 align:start position:0%
proofing or like I think actually if we just

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.170 align:start position:0%
just if if we were defining Auto bump anyway

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.910 align:start position:0%
if if we were defining Auto bump anyway then we need to have a Flags field

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.430 align:start position:0%
then we need to have a Flags field for the album flag and so we can easily

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.930 align:start position:0%
for the album flag and so we can easily extend it later

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.690 align:start position:0%
extend it later and so I think you know the bumpable

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.370 align:start position:0%
and so I think you know the bumpable versus no bumpable that could be a V2

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.390 align:start position:0%
versus no bumpable that could be a V2 feature

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
feature but I think unless there's like a

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
but I think unless there's like a strong strong one for it now we can just

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.069 align:start position:0%
strong strong one for it now we can just leave that off for now and just have the

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:26.650 align:start position:0%
leave that off for now and just have the autobump flag

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.470 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that the Autobahn really benefit the network

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.890 align:start position:0%
benefit the network it might benefit the ease of use but not

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:43.010 align:start position:0%
it might benefit the ease of use but not necessarily the network itself right

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.089 align:start position:0%
sure I guess the you are having more more IO churn for sure

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:52.250 align:start position:0%
more IO churn for sure I guess the there didn't seem to be a

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.230 align:start position:0%
I guess the there didn't seem to be a great solution for the contract instance

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.150 align:start position:0%
great solution for the contract instance and contract was in the case without

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.109 align:start position:0%
and contract was in the case without Autobahn so I think you know it for it

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:03.050 align:start position:0%
Autobahn so I think you know it for it might be useful to say maybe like

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.870 align:start position:0%
might be useful to say maybe like I think those two entries need something

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.210 align:start position:0%
I think those two entries need something like Auto bump or need some way of

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.609 align:start position:0%
like Auto bump or need some way of essentially like automatically or

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:12.290 align:start position:0%
essentially like automatically or pooling rent together in some way

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
pooling rent together in some way because that was kind of the the the

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.530 align:start position:0%
because that was kind of the the the thing we were trying to think about with

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.630 align:start position:0%
thing we were trying to think about with the contract wasm is okay you have like

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.010 align:start position:0%
the contract wasm is okay you have like four or five different instances that

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.349 align:start position:0%
four or five different instances that all have the same was and back end how

00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
all have the same was and back end how do you equitably and equally share the

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:35.050 align:start position:0%
do you equitably and equally share the load when it comes to expiration ledgers

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.770 align:start position:0%
I I think that my my the direction that I'm thinking about is that if someone

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.290 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about is that if someone was uploading a contract

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.490 align:start position:0%
was uploading a contract I want to see his hotels involvement in

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.609 align:start position:0%
I want to see his hotels involvement in the future on maintaining that

00:41:55.619 --> 00:41:58.130 align:start position:0%
the future on maintaining that and not so much on leaving it and

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.890 align:start position:0%
and not so much on leaving it and assuming that it will be funded by

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.410 align:start position:0%
assuming that it will be funded by someone else

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
like I I want to see like a activity right on that contract from the owner

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.990 align:start position:0%
right on that contract from the owner and not by someone else that might be

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.150 align:start position:0%
and not by someone else that might be inherently using it

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.609 align:start position:0%
inherently using it oh fishes that contracts don't have an

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:26.210 align:start position:0%
oh fishes that contracts don't have an owner like who doesn't can be reported

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
owner like who doesn't can be reported by anyone and you pay anyone

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.190 align:start position:0%
by anyone and you pay anyone so you know if you have a the creditable

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.730 align:start position:0%
so you know if you have a the creditable implementation that people are using

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.609 align:start position:0%
implementation that people are using there is no clear owner yes someone

00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:42.589 align:start position:0%
there is no clear owner yes someone might have written in the code but

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:45.530 align:start position:0%
might have written in the code but anyone can deploy it and

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.750 align:start position:0%
anyone can deploy it and yeah it's kind of hard to track to

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
yeah it's kind of hard to track to anyone and demand you know maintenance

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.730 align:start position:0%
anyone and demand you know maintenance from someone

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.750 align:start position:0%
from someone I mean you could expect it but it's

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.290 align:start position:0%
I mean you could expect it but it's like the Canada universally demand this

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.930 align:start position:0%
like the Canada universally demand this yeah I feel like there's kind of the the

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
yeah I feel like there's kind of the the concept of like a library contract is

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.650 align:start position:0%
concept of like a library contract is definitely a big thing on ethereum and

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
definitely a big thing on ethereum and so it feels like an unfair expectation

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.150 align:start position:0%
so it feels like an unfair expectation to write something like a like a Dap

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.250 align:start position:0%
to write something like a like a Dap implementation that has you know that's

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.990 align:start position:0%
implementation that has you know that's that's more of a library function and

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.569 align:start position:0%
that's more of a library function and expect the library owner to be the sole

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:19.490 align:start position:0%
expect the library owner to be the sole payer for that even though other

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.650 align:start position:0%
payer for that even though other contract instances are using that

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
contract instances are using that Wiseman making money off the wasm it

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.609 align:start position:0%
Wiseman making money off the wasm it just seems weird that if five you know

00:43:25.619 --> 00:43:27.829 align:start position:0%
just seems weird that if five you know different contract instances are using

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:30.829 align:start position:0%
different contract instances are using and profiting of wasm that only the you

00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:32.150 align:start position:0%
and profiting of wasm that only the you know entity that originally deployed the

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.410 align:start position:0%
know entity that originally deployed the wasm should be on the hook for paying

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
wasm should be on the hook for paying for it

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.370 align:start position:0%
so I would argue that if someone is using something for free

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.710 align:start position:0%
using something for free then he shouldn't

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.109 align:start position:0%
then he shouldn't instead you should either pay the author

00:43:48.119 --> 00:43:52.190 align:start position:0%
instead you should either pay the author right and generate money right out of

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.990 align:start position:0%
right and generate money right out of that right or basically copy it in from

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.170 align:start position:0%
that right or basically copy it in from now on he would be the owner of that

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
now on he would be the owner of that piece

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.430 align:start position:0%
piece what do you mean by copy though I feel

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.809 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by copy though I feel like that's why it works for Network

00:44:05.819 --> 00:44:07.370 align:start position:0%
like that's why it works for Network perspective because now you have like

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.430 align:start position:0%
perspective because now you have like five identical copies of the same ones

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.650 align:start position:0%
five identical copies of the same ones yeah the current design is exclusively

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
yeah the current design is exclusively like encouraging sharing the code

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.170 align:start position:0%
like encouraging sharing the code because we don't want to store it

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.569 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to store it tens or hundreds of duplicate version

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:22.609 align:start position:0%
tens or hundreds of duplicate version drops because it's the biggest lecture

00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:26.930 align:start position:0%
drops because it's the biggest lecture entries by far so you don't want to

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.490 align:start position:0%
entries by far so you don't want to encourage code to paste and you know

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.190 align:start position:0%
encourage code to paste and you know fragment system or anything and

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.230 align:start position:0%
fragment system or anything and again wait

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.349 align:start position:0%
again wait I think I I went around here but in dth

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
I think I I went around here but in dth for all like a lot of the things I

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.849 align:start position:0%
for all like a lot of the things I implemented by proxy patterns and Stuff

00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:43.849 align:start position:0%
implemented by proxy patterns and Stuff Etc again a lot of instances are

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
Etc again a lot of instances are referring to say another single contract

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.190 align:start position:0%
referring to say another single contract instance and

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.010 align:start position:0%
instance and you know you do not deploy your own like

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
you know you do not deploy your own like copy of unislove and you do not maintain

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.490 align:start position:0%
copy of unislove and you do not maintain it instead of it you can just refer to a

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.190 align:start position:0%
it instead of it you can just refer to a proxied instance of unisol that is yes

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.069 align:start position:0%
proxied instance of unisol that is yes getting updated by someone probably but

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:07.069 align:start position:0%
getting updated by someone probably but I don't think it's fair to say that a Do

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.510 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's fair to say that a Do Your Own Thing

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.910 align:start position:0%
Your Own Thing

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.550 align:start position:0%
yeah

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.970 align:start position:0%
I know I would be happy to see some incentive model Incorporated here in is

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.910 align:start position:0%
incentive model Incorporated here in is part of that but you know maybe that's

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
part of that but you know maybe that's something that we need to you know like

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.309 align:start position:0%
something that we need to you know like think separately of the

00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:32.990 align:start position:0%
think separately of the countries

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.410 align:start position:0%
do you have any thought about that

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.930 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we we should allow the we should allow contracts to be detached

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.710 align:start position:0%
should allow contracts to be detached from a concept of an owner

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
from a concept of an owner you know for for a lot of legal reasons

00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:53.930 align:start position:0%
you know for for a lot of legal reasons this is better for some contracts you

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.930 align:start position:0%
this is better for some contracts you know like the uni swap contracts are not

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.109 align:start position:0%
know like the uni swap contracts are not upgradable they don't have an owner

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
upgradable they don't have an owner and and that's the way they want it like

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.089 align:start position:0%
and and that's the way they want it like it exists like that for a reason right

00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:07.010 align:start position:0%
it exists like that for a reason right so I don't think we should we should

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.990 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we should we should kind of like own over emphasize this

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.710 align:start position:0%
kind of like own over emphasize this concept of an owner

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.750 align:start position:0%
that's a good argument

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
Aaron do you think it would be reasonable to constrain Auto bump to

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
reasonable to constrain Auto bump to these entries which are the ones which

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.329 align:start position:0%
these entries which are the ones which are going to benefit from the most so

00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:28.430 align:start position:0%
are going to benefit from the most so not all ledger entry is not contract

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
not all ledger entry is not contract data

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
data but just the contract code and the

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.010 align:start position:0%
but just the contract code and the contract instances

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
contract instances yeah I think contract code contract

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.849 align:start position:0%
yeah I think contract code contract instances for sure

00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:40.609 align:start position:0%
instances for sure but I think there's also the reason

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:42.829 align:start position:0%
but I think there's also the reason why I wanted to Define autobump is I

00:46:42.839 --> 00:46:44.329 align:start position:0%
why I wanted to Define autobump is I think there's also

00:46:44.339 --> 00:46:47.809 align:start position:0%
think there's also areas where contract data should be Auto

00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:48.829 align:start position:0%
areas where contract data should be Auto bumped

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.630 align:start position:0%
bumped so like for instance like if you have a

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.950 align:start position:0%
so like for instance like if you have a tax

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.089 align:start position:0%
tax and then there are like entries on

00:46:53.099 --> 00:46:56.450 align:start position:0%
and then there are like entries on the Decks that many users of the Dex use

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
the Decks that many users of the Dex use the Audubon feature is kind of just

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:59.630 align:start position:0%
the Audubon feature is kind of just so that these entries are kind of like

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.609 align:start position:0%
so that these entries are kind of like paid for by all users instead of you

00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:04.550 align:start position:0%
paid for by all users instead of you know one unlucky user so I think

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.290 align:start position:0%
know one unlucky user so I think I think there's still there are

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.730 align:start position:0%
I think there's still there are definitely use cases where you'd want

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.770 align:start position:0%
definitely use cases where you'd want something like an autobump primitive for

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.630 align:start position:0%
something like an autobump primitive for contract data

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.010 align:start position:0%
contract data however I could definitely see a use

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.230 align:start position:0%
however I could definitely see a use case where this is not the default as a

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.690 align:start position:0%
case where this is not the default as a flag where contract instances and

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.510 align:start position:0%
flag where contract instances and contract wasm receive bumps

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
contract wasm receive bumps by requirement and then data defaults

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.250 align:start position:0%
by requirement and then data defaults to false but you can turn it on if you

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
to false but you can turn it on if you want

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:28.910 align:start position:0%
want because I still think there are

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.710 align:start position:0%
because I still think there are definitely use cases where you'd want

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.510 align:start position:0%
definitely use cases where you'd want something like this for contract data I

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.710 align:start position:0%
something like this for contract data I don't know if it's a common case but

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's a common case but there definitely are significant cases

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.450 align:start position:0%
there definitely are significant cases I think it's a very common case like

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.250 align:start position:0%
I think it's a very common case like effectively everything in a in a

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.050 align:start position:0%
effectively everything in a in a contract that is like a global variable

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.569 align:start position:0%
contract that is like a global variable or Global state that doesn't

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:46.790 align:start position:0%
or Global state that doesn't specifically adhere to to an account

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
specifically adhere to to an account like you know like in a liquidity pool

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
like you know like in a liquidity pool the actual like pool values are global

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.430 align:start position:0%
the actual like pool values are global and

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.130 align:start position:0%
and need to be bumped

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.829 align:start position:0%
need to be bumped we have been discussing this for some

00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:04.609 align:start position:0%
we have been discussing this for some time what about explicitly change

00:48:04.619 --> 00:48:06.589 align:start position:0%
time what about explicitly change the data to the contract instance like

00:48:06.599 --> 00:48:08.809 align:start position:0%
the data to the contract instance like do we anticipate

00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.990 align:start position:0%
do we anticipate some short case where you know the data

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.690 align:start position:0%
some short case where you know the data is kind of global but it's not once per

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.109 align:start position:0%
is kind of global but it's not once per contract or something if not then maybe

00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:21.890 align:start position:0%
contract or something if not then maybe we just for the small Global state of

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.010 align:start position:0%
we just for the small Global state of the contract in the instant century and

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.050 align:start position:0%
the contract in the instant century and then you know it's subject to the same

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.630 align:start position:0%
then you know it's subject to the same Ultra bomb obviously because if you

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.790 align:start position:0%
Ultra bomb obviously because if you think about it it's kind of a part of

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.089 align:start position:0%
think about it it's kind of a part of the contract

00:48:37.859 --> 00:48:39.349 align:start position:0%
that's another consideration here I mean I guess the question is how

00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:40.849 align:start position:0%
mean I guess the question is how monolithic do we want to be right

00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:44.270 align:start position:0%
monolithic do we want to be right because the issue with that is that

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.370 align:start position:0%
because the issue with that is that the so say the advantage is that like

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.809 align:start position:0%
the so say the advantage is that like if you have like a

00:48:47.819 --> 00:48:50.870 align:start position:0%
if you have like a a contract instance that's like has a

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.730 align:start position:0%
a contract instance that's like has a very large amount Global state every

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.309 align:start position:0%
very large amount Global state every call must bump all that state whereas

00:48:55.319 --> 00:48:56.569 align:start position:0%
call must bump all that state whereas like I said for instance where the

00:48:56.579 --> 00:48:58.130 align:start position:0%
like I said for instance where the liquid equals so there's like a poor

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.109 align:start position:0%
liquid equals so there's like a poor implementation that has like 10

00:49:00.119 --> 00:49:01.550 align:start position:0%
implementation that has like 10 different like asset swaps or something

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.650 align:start position:0%
different like asset swaps or something and so even if you only access one you

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.210 align:start position:0%
and so even if you only access one you have to bump the other nine implicitly

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.309 align:start position:0%
have to bump the other nine implicitly whereas

00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:09.290 align:start position:0%
whereas if you don't title and you keep

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
if you don't title and you keep everything individual then you only have

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.470 align:start position:0%
everything individual then you only have to bump the entries you actually touch

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.170 align:start position:0%
to bump the entries you actually touch now I don't know like in practice

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.849 align:start position:0%
now I don't know like in practice contracts might be small enough that

00:49:19.859 --> 00:49:21.890 align:start position:0%
contracts might be small enough that this isn't really a big issue it

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a big issue it definitely does simplify some things and

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.089 align:start position:0%
definitely does simplify some things and decreases our right amplification as

00:49:26.099 --> 00:49:28.309 align:start position:0%
decreases our right amplification as well because you'd only need to write at

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:35.950 align:start position:0%
well because you'd only need to write at most one bump per contract instance

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.670 align:start position:0%
so this effectively goes sorry go aheadly

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.589 align:start position:0%
sorry go aheadly I think it's difficult to distinguish

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:45.410 align:start position:0%
I think it's difficult to distinguish between Global and individual because

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:46.730 align:start position:0%
between Global and individual because like they're definitely going to be

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.609 align:start position:0%
like they're definitely going to be contracts that have like nexuses like

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:51.650 align:start position:0%
contracts that have like nexuses like where it's not Global but maybe it

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.190 align:start position:0%
where it's not Global but maybe it involves like multiple participants

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
involves like multiple participants so

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.130 align:start position:0%
so I don't know like where do we draw the

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.809 align:start position:0%
I don't know like where do we draw the line between

00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
line between something should be a shared cost versus

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.309 align:start position:0%
something should be a shared cost versus being an individual cost

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:07.010 align:start position:0%
being an individual cost seems too difficult to do that

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.630 align:start position:0%
seems too difficult to do that yeah other than like the really General

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.390 align:start position:0%
yeah other than like the really General cases of contract code should definitely

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.609 align:start position:0%
cases of contract code should definitely be a shared cost

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:14.450 align:start position:0%
be a shared cost

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.250 align:start position:0%
like in for contract data I don't think we can make that call like I think the

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.530 align:start position:0%
we can make that call like I think the country developers do

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.050 align:start position:0%
country developers do foreign

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.550 align:start position:0%
foreign ly think the safest option is just to

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.990 align:start position:0%
ly think the safest option is just to default this to true

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.089 align:start position:0%
default this to true and then maybe expose a flag just

00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:31.250 align:start position:0%
and then maybe expose a flag just because I feel like the benefit or the

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.290 align:start position:0%
because I feel like the benefit or the drawback to Auto bumping something where

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.329 align:start position:0%
drawback to Auto bumping something where when it shouldn't be Auto bumped is very

00:50:35.339 --> 00:50:37.550 align:start position:0%
when it shouldn't be Auto bumped is very minimal because the whole idea is that

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.589 align:start position:0%
minimal because the whole idea is that for the bump to be a small bump such

00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:41.329 align:start position:0%
for the bump to be a small bump such that if lots of users are accessing it

00:50:41.339 --> 00:50:43.190 align:start position:0%
that if lots of users are accessing it over time it grows but for instance

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.470 align:start position:0%
over time it grows but for instance right if you have a balance

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.030 align:start position:0%
right if you have a balance it you know and you say view balance

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.069 align:start position:0%
it you know and you say view balance and you have to pay 10 extra ledgers of

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:51.349 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay 10 extra ledgers of rent on the one entry I mean that will

00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
rent on the one entry I mean that will literally like that might be less than

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.549 align:start position:0%
literally like that might be less than like an Excel I'd be measured in strips

00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:58.309 align:start position:0%
like an Excel I'd be measured in strips and so I feel like the the drawback to

00:50:58.319 --> 00:51:00.710 align:start position:0%
and so I feel like the the drawback to not having autobombs can be high if you

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.589 align:start position:0%
not having autobombs can be high if you have a shared you know you know

00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:06.170 align:start position:0%
have a shared you know you know Global Entry that you forget to bump and

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.730 align:start position:0%
Global Entry that you forget to bump and then for the entire lifetime of that

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.349 align:start position:0%
then for the entire lifetime of that contract you have to manually bump it

00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:11.270 align:start position:0%
contract you have to manually bump it it's expensive I feel like that's a much

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.190 align:start position:0%
it's expensive I feel like that's a much worse failure case than the other case

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.710 align:start position:0%
worse failure case than the other case where you sometimes have to pay a small

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.270 align:start position:0%
where you sometimes have to pay a small additional fee to access some entries

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.890 align:start position:0%
leaning into that is there is a really a big downside to not requiring Auto bump

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.630 align:start position:0%
big downside to not requiring Auto bump like what's not having the option not

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.609 align:start position:0%
like what's not having the option not making configurable oh yeah just like

00:51:31.619 --> 00:51:33.530 align:start position:0%
making configurable oh yeah just like requiring it like universally

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.430 align:start position:0%
requiring it like universally yeah I personally think there's I think

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I personally think there's I think there's not a I think there maybe is one

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.950 align:start position:0%
there's not a I think there maybe is one negative use case we have Oracle data

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.210 align:start position:0%
negative use case we have Oracle data that should really only live for like

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.950 align:start position:0%
that should really only live for like five minutes or ten minutes

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.049 align:start position:0%
five minutes or ten minutes it would be really annoying if you

00:51:48.059 --> 00:51:50.510 align:start position:0%
it would be really annoying if you know especially if this data is accessed

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.089 align:start position:0%
know especially if this data is accessed often in like a like a DEX sort of

00:51:53.099 --> 00:51:54.770 align:start position:0%
often in like a like a DEX sort of environment I think that would be really

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.170 align:start position:0%
environment I think that would be really annoying if you access this thing so

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.030 align:start position:0%
annoying if you access this thing so much in a five minute lifetime such that

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.010 align:start position:0%
much in a five minute lifetime such that it always lives for like six hours or

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.930 align:start position:0%
it always lives for like six hours or like two weeks after

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.130 align:start position:0%
like two weeks after you know even though you should only

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.770 align:start position:0%
you know even though you should only do five minutes so I think for like very

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.930 align:start position:0%
do five minutes so I think for like very short-lived entries and like Oracle

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.430 align:start position:0%
short-lived entries and like Oracle data there's a strong use case

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.890 align:start position:0%
data there's a strong use case outside of that I don't see a super

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
outside of that I don't see a super strong use case

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
strong use case for for not just repairing oil pumps

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.309 align:start position:0%
for for not just repairing oil pumps everywhere

00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
see are you suggesting setting into true

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.770 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting setting into true for every type of Entry or just for

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.329 align:start position:0%
for every type of Entry or just for restorable entries because like for the

00:52:26.339 --> 00:52:27.770 align:start position:0%
restorable entries because like for the Oracle use case that you're describing

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.390 align:start position:0%
Oracle use case that you're describing Garand wouldn't they use temporary

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.589 align:start position:0%
Garand wouldn't they use temporary entries for that

00:52:30.599 --> 00:52:33.470 align:start position:0%
entries for that yeah yes I think so I think right now

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.450 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I think so I think right now we are talking about a unified interface

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.609 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a unified interface where both restorable and temporary have

00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:39.230 align:start position:0%
where both restorable and temporary have the same expiration Ledger interface and

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:44.569 align:start position:0%
the same expiration Ledger interface and both have the same Auto buttons

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
yeah I feel like contracts put in contracts avoid the issue that

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.170 align:start position:0%
put in contracts avoid the issue that you're describing

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
you're describing you know where you accidentally

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.450 align:start position:0%
you know where you accidentally continue to rebump a temporary entry

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.190 align:start position:0%
continue to rebump a temporary entry by

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.530 align:start position:0%
by I guess like moving on to using like a

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.049 align:start position:0%
I guess like moving on to using like a contract that uses a temporary

00:53:03.059 --> 00:53:05.329 align:start position:0%
contract that uses a temporary for five minutes

00:53:05.339 --> 00:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
for five minutes I guess how would people be referencing

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.710 align:start position:0%
I guess how would people be referencing that like an hour from now

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
that like an hour from now well no so that's the issue right so

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.849 align:start position:0%
well no so that's the issue right so it's that no one is referencing it now

00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:16.010 align:start position:0%
it's that no one is referencing it now and for now but in that five minutes

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.349 align:start position:0%
and for now but in that five minutes enough people referenced it such that it

00:53:18.359 --> 00:53:20.270 align:start position:0%
enough people referenced it such that it was aren't bumped so much that it will

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.650 align:start position:0%
was aren't bumped so much that it will live significantly longer than five

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.430 align:start position:0%
live significantly longer than five minutes

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.470 align:start position:0%
minutes so the issue is no one will access it

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.569 align:start position:0%
so the issue is no one will access it within an hour but it will live you know

00:53:26.579 --> 00:53:36.829 align:start position:0%
within an hour but it will live you know an hour two hours or however long

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.970 align:start position:0%
so this I think what you're just I guess so

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.270 align:start position:0%
guess so what if Auto bumping wasn't

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
what if Auto bumping wasn't didn't bump it a fixed amount what if it

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.609 align:start position:0%
didn't bump it a fixed amount what if it bumped up to some cap

00:53:49.619 --> 00:53:52.069 align:start position:0%
bumped up to some cap I mean it does bump up to some cap

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:53.930 align:start position:0%
I mean it does bump up to some cap because we have

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.470 align:start position:0%
because we have we have a a maximum rent balance

00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.230 align:start position:0%
we have a a maximum rent balance for a maximum expiration Ledger due

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.670 align:start position:0%
for a maximum expiration Ledger due to you know issues we discussed earlier

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.829 align:start position:0%
to you know issues we discussed earlier and so there is a cap it's just that the

00:54:03.839 --> 00:54:05.450 align:start position:0%
and so there is a cap it's just that the issue is that

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.309 align:start position:0%
issue is that you know that cap will make sense for

00:54:07.319 --> 00:54:08.329 align:start position:0%
you know that cap will make sense for some entries but doesn't make sense for

00:54:08.339 --> 00:54:10.250 align:start position:0%
some entries but doesn't make sense for others so for instance like if the cap

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.829 align:start position:0%
others so for instance like if the cap is six months and in the extreme case

00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:14.150 align:start position:0%
is six months and in the extreme case you have an oracle entry That was

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.530 align:start position:0%
you have an oracle entry That was supposed to last five minutes that lasts

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.750 align:start position:0%
supposed to last five minutes that lasts up to the cap of six months that's a lot

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:32.750 align:start position:0%
up to the cap of six months that's a lot of wasted fees

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.829 align:start position:0%
okay so it sort of feels go ahead

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:39.410 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry it's sort of so this is the last

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.910 align:start position:0%
sorry it's sort of so this is the last thing I'm going to say I think on this

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.849 align:start position:0%
thing I'm going to say I think on this it sort of feels like

00:54:43.859 --> 00:54:46.549 align:start position:0%
it sort of feels like Auto bump okay we could argue that what

00:54:46.559 --> 00:54:48.890 align:start position:0%
Auto bump okay we could argue that what Obama should be configurable per entry

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.670 align:start position:0%
Obama should be configurable per entry but it also sounds like the amount of

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
but it also sounds like the amount of this thing should be Auto bumped before

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.990 align:start position:0%
this thing should be Auto bumped before if we're making a configurable

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.569 align:start position:0%
if we're making a configurable it's not really a binary yes or no it's

00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:01.730 align:start position:0%
it's not really a binary yes or no it's more like an amount

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.430 align:start position:0%
more like an amount like as a contract developer

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.089 align:start position:0%
like as a contract developer

00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:09.410 align:start position:0%
the contract developers really

00:55:10.859 --> 00:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
probably like the person who's gonna know best like how long if this is going

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.930 align:start position:0%
know best like how long if this is going to get bumped it needs to be bumped for

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.670 align:start position:0%
to get bumped it needs to be bumped for or I guess it's some combination of the

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.970 align:start position:0%
or I guess it's some combination of the contract developer and the user but

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.309 align:start position:0%
contract developer and the user but yeah just I'm a little skeptical of

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:25.910 align:start position:0%
yeah just I'm a little skeptical of allowing contracts to Define you know

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.730 align:start position:0%
allowing contracts to Define you know like access fee amounts right because if

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.650 align:start position:0%
like access fee amounts right because if a contract was like oh you know like

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.569 align:start position:0%
a contract was like oh you know like even if it's not malicious it's just

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:34.250 align:start position:0%
even if it's not malicious it's just like a stupid design it's like hey this

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:35.930 align:start position:0%
like a stupid design it's like hey this should have six months and it's like a

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
should have six months and it's like a you know a thousand or it's like a you

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.650 align:start position:0%
you know a thousand or it's like a you know 10 kilobyte entry that you know

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
know 10 kilobyte entry that you know requires a six-month bomb just to access

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.549 align:start position:0%
requires a six-month bomb just to access that's a pretty poor ux

00:55:43.559 --> 00:55:45.589 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty poor ux yeah I'm like this is just the slippery

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:48.589 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm like this is just the slippery slope of configurability like the more I

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
slope of configurability like the more I yeah in some ways maybe we need

00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
yeah in some ways maybe we need you know to Paul's Point around like

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.910 align:start position:0%
you know to Paul's Point around like the not making things configurable

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.930 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the trade-off we make we make it okay like temporary entries

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.549 align:start position:0%
make it okay like temporary entries might get bumped more than what they

00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:05.809 align:start position:0%
might get bumped more than what they need to they might live around a little

00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:09.290 align:start position:0%
need to they might live around a little bit longer but that's a trade-off for

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.390 align:start position:0%
bit longer but that's a trade-off for

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:23.870 align:start position:0%
for all these other reasons

00:56:27.059 --> 00:56:30.049 align:start position:0%
okay so we're at time it definitely sounds like

00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:31.970 align:start position:0%
it definitely sounds like everyone's on board with Ledger

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.890 align:start position:0%
everyone's on board with Ledger exploration moving on from rent

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.809 align:start position:0%
exploration moving on from rent balance

00:56:35.819 --> 00:56:38.089 align:start position:0%
balance there are the questions of which

00:56:38.099 --> 00:56:40.190 align:start position:0%
there are the questions of which flags we expose

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.349 align:start position:0%
flags we expose and there is the question that Dima

00:56:42.359 --> 00:56:44.750 align:start position:0%
and there is the question that Dima raised about revisit revisiting the the

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.309 align:start position:0%
raised about revisit revisiting the the idea of contract attached state

00:56:49.319 --> 00:56:53.089 align:start position:0%
idea of contract attached state which we decided against in the

00:56:53.099 --> 00:56:57.410 align:start position:0%
which we decided against in the context of metadata but that

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.690 align:start position:0%
context of metadata but that wasn't

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.930 align:start position:0%
wasn't yeah it wasn't a landslide of

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:06.950 align:start position:0%
yeah it wasn't a landslide of opinions there so maybe it's worth

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.630 align:start position:0%
opinions there so maybe it's worth

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.010 align:start position:0%
rethinking about that so again it does sound like you have a lot to work

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.390 align:start position:0%
does sound like you have a lot to work with right now in terms of Ledger

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.890 align:start position:0%
with right now in terms of Ledger exploration

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.690 align:start position:0%
exploration I would try to summarize this

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.750 align:start position:0%
I would try to summarize this question about which kind of Flags

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.490 align:start position:0%
question about which kind of Flags We've we've just debated and and

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.010 align:start position:0%
We've we've just debated and and starting a discussion around that to

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.690 align:start position:0%
starting a discussion around that to give people some asynchronous time to

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.849 align:start position:0%
give people some asynchronous time to think about that

00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:30.950 align:start position:0%
think about that and Dima if you could kind of like

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.950 align:start position:0%
and Dima if you could kind of like resurface this idea of kind of like

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.290 align:start position:0%
resurface this idea of kind of like contract attached state

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.650 align:start position:0%
contract attached state and the the benefits of that

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
and the the benefits of that both in this context and in others I

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:47.329 align:start position:0%
both in this context and in others I think that could be beneficial

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:57.170 align:start position:0%
Garen is there anything else you know that sounds good okay

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.069 align:start position:0%
Dima I saw you unmuted for a sec there yeah I just want to just say that

00:58:01.079 --> 00:58:04.250 align:start position:0%
there yeah I just want to just say that yeah when I have some time oh right I

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.750 align:start position:0%
yeah when I have some time oh right I guess is that my nature with the

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.349 align:start position:0%
guess is that my nature with the contract data you said through the time

00:58:08.359 --> 00:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
contract data you said through the time yeah so I I don't know if you have

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.849 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I don't know if you have enough time to get it shipped into the

00:58:13.859 --> 00:58:17.089 align:start position:0%
enough time to get it shipped into the one even everyone is on board but yeah I

00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:21.170 align:start position:0%
one even everyone is on board but yeah I need to think a bit more about this

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.010 align:start position:0%
awesome okay thank you everyone it's been

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you everyone it's been a great session see y'all next week
